## Deadlines

### When are the deadlines?

CS50x does not have individual deadlines for assignments. You are welcome to work on and submit at your own pace.

The overall deadline for the course is currently end-of-day, Eastern time, on 31 December 2024 at 11:59PM. For your convenience, we will often render this time in your local timezone ([2024-12-31T23:59:00-05:00](https://time.cs50.io/20241231T235900-0500)).

If all required work is turned in before the above time and ultimately receives a satisfactory grade (whether before or shortly after that deadline), you will be considered to have completed CS50x.

### If I don’t finish the course before end-of-day 31 December 2024, what will happen?

On 1 January 2025, the course will be updated to a 2025 version. Your progress from 2024 will be carried forward to the 2025 version (see below). After 31 December 2024, you may only submit the 2025 version’s problem sets and will need to satisfy whatever requirements are in place for CS50x 2025. Your carryover progress (as described below) from 2023 or prior will **not** carry forward into 2025, however.

### If I started CS50x before 2024, can I resume?

Yes, any progress you made on past years’ problem sets has been carried forward to your CS50x 2024 gradebook. Note that individual problem results from past years are not shown, but if the corresponding problem _set_ and lab was completed, you’ll see it marked with a green circle and included in your progress bar at the top. **Moving forward, though, you must submit CS50x 2024’s problem sets**. Work from prior versions of the course may not be submitted for credit.

Here is how you should transition from the 2023 course to the 2024 course:

| Completed in 2023  | Resume your studies with                                     |

| Problem Sets 0 – 7 | [Week 8 and Problem Set 8](../weeks/8/) of CS50x 2024.       |
| Problem Sets 0 – 8 | [Week 9 and Problem Set 9](../weeks/9/) of CS50x 2024.       |
| Problem Sets 0 – 9 | [Week 10 and the Final Project](../weeks/10/) of CS50x 2024. |

### How was the work I completed as part of CS50x 2023 carried forward into CS50x 2024?

Credit was given for work done in CS50x 2023 as follows. Note that you must have completed1 **each row** in a box in the left column before 1 January 2024 in order to have received credit for the corresponding problem set(s) and lab(s) in the right column. If you have only completed _some_ of the items in a box in the left column, no credit will be given for that work. (The carryover is done on a per-week basis, not a per-problem basis.) Visit your [CS50x Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) to see the weeks that have been credited, if any.
