## Data structures

- **Data structures** are programming constructs that allow us to store information in different layouts in our computer’s memory.
- To build a data structure, we’ll need some tools we’ve seen:
  - `struct` to create custom data types
  - `.` to access properties in a structure
  - `*` to go to an address in memory pointed to by a pointer
