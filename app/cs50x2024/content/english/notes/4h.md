## get_int

- We can implement `get_int` ourselves with a C library function, `scanf`:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          int x;
          printf("x: ");
          scanf("%i", &x);
          printf("x: %i\n", x);
      }

  - `scanf` takes a format, `%i`, so the input is “scanned” for that format, and the address in memory where we want that input to go. But `scanf` doesn’t have much error checking, so we might not get an integer.

- We can try to get a string the same way:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          char *s = NULL;
          printf("s: ");
          scanf("%s", s);
          printf("s: %s\n", s);
      }

  - But we haven’t actually allocated any memory for `s` (`s` is `NULL`, or not pointing to anything), so we might want to call `char s[5]` to allocate an array of 5 characters for our string. Then, `s` will be treated as a pointer in `scanf` and `printf`.
  - Now, if the user types in a string of length 4 or less, our program will work safely. But if the user types in a longer string, `scanf` might be trying to write past the end of our array into unknown memory, causing our program to crash.
