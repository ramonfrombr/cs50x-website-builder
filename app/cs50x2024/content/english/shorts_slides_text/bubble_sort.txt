Bubble Sort
• In bubble sort, the idea of the algorithm is to move higher valued elements generally towards the right and lower value elements generally towards the left.
In pseudocode:
• Set swap counter to a non-zero value
• Repeat until the swap counter is 0:
• Reset swap counter to 0
• Look at each adjacent pair
• If two adjacent elements are not in order, swap them and add one to the swap counter

Bubble Sort
• Worst-case scenario: The array is in reverse order; we have to “bubble” each of the n elements all the way across the array, and since we can only fully bubble one element into position per pass, we must do this n times.
• Best-case scenario: The array is already perfectly sorted, and we make no swaps on the first pass.
