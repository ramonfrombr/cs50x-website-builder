## Frosh IMs

- Frosh IMs or _froshims_ is a web application that allows students to register for intermural sports.
- Create a folder by typing `mkdir froshims` in the terminal window. Then, type `cd froshims` to browse to this folder. Within, create a directory called templates by typing `mkdir templates`. Finally, type `code app.py` and write code as follows:

      # Implements a registration form using a select menu

      from flask import Flask, render_template, request

      app = Flask(__name__)

      SPORTS = [
          "Basketball",
          "Soccer",
          "Ultimate Frisbee"
      ]


      @app.route("/")
      def index():
          return render_template("index.html", sports=SPORTS)


      @app.route("/register", methods=["POST"])
      def register():

          # Validate submission
          if not request.form.get("name") or request.form.get("sport") not in SPORTS:
              return render_template("failure.html")

          # Confirm registration
          return render_template("success.html")

  Notice that a `failure` option is provided, such that a failure message will be displayed to the user if the `name` or `sport` field is not properly filled out.

- Next, create a file in the `templates` folder called `index.html` by typing `code templates/index.html` and write code as follows:

      {% extends "layout.html" %}

      {% block body %}
          <h1>Register</h1>
          <form action="/register" method="post">
              <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="name" placeholder="Name" type="text">
              <select name="sport">
                  <option disabled selected>Sport</option>
                  {% for sport in sports %}
                      <option value="{{ sport }}">{{ sport }}</option>
                  {% endfor %}
              </select>
              <button type="submit">Register</button>
          </form>
      {% endblock %}

- Next, create a file called `layout.html` by typing `code templates/layout.html` and write code as follows:

      <!DOCTYPE html>

      <html lang="en">
          <head>
              <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width">
              <title>froshims</title>
          </head>
          <body>
              {% block body %}{% endblock %}
          </body>
      </html>

- Fourth, create a file in templates called `success.html` as follows:

      {% extends "layout.html" %}

      {% block body %}
          You are registered!
      {% endblock %}

- Finally, create a file in templates called `failure.html` as follows:

      {% extends "layout.html" %}

      {% block body %}
          You are not registered!
      {% endblock %}
