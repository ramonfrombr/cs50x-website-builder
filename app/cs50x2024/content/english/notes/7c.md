- SQL is a language that lets us work with a relational database, an application lets us store data and work with them more quickly than with a CSV.
- With `.schema`, we can see how the format for the table for our data is created:

      sqlite> .schema
      CREATE TABLE favorites(
        "Timestamp" TEXT,
        "title" TEXT,
        "genres" TEXT
      );

- It turns out that, when working with data, we only need four operations:
  - `CREATE`
  - `READ`
  - `UPDATE`
  - `DELETE`
- In SQL, the commands to perform each of these operations are:
  - `INSERT`
  - `SELECT`
  - `UPDATE`
  - `DELETE`
- First, we’ll need to insert a table with the `CREATE TABLE table (column type, ...);` command.
- SQL, too, has its own data types to optimize the amount of space used for storing data:
  - `BLOB`, for “binary large object”, raw binary data that might represent files
  - `INTEGER`
    - `smallint`
    - `integer`
    - `bigint`
  - `NUMERIC`
    - `boolean`
    - `date`
    - `datetime`
    - `numeric(scale,precision)`, which solves floating-point imprecision by using as many bits as needed, for each digit before and after the decimal point
    - `time`
    - `timestamp`
  - `REAL`
    - `real`, for floating-point values
    - `double precision`, with more bits
  - `TEXT`
    - `char(n)`, for an exact number of characters
    - `varchar(n)`, for a variable number of characters, up to a certain limit
    - `text`
- SQLite is one database application that supports SQL, and there are many companies with server applications that support SQL, includes Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Microsoft Access.
- After inserting values, we can use functions to perform calculations, too:
  - `AVG`
  - `COUNT`
  - `DISTINCT`, for getting distinct values without duplicates
  - `MAX`
  - `MIN`
  - …
- There are also other operations we can combine as needed:
  - `WHERE`, matching on some strict condition
  - `LIKE`, matching on substrings for text
  - `LIMIT`
  - `GROUP BY`
  - `ORDER BY`
  - `JOIN`, combining data from multiple tables
- We can update data with `UPDATE table SET column=value WHERE condition;`, which could include 0, 1, or more rows depending on our condition. For example, we might say `UPDATE favorites SET title = "The Office" WHERE title LIKE "%office"`, and that will set all the rows with the title containing “office” to be “The Office” so we can make them consistent.
- And we can remove matching rows with `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;`, as in `DELETE FROM favorites WHERE title = "Friends";`.
- We can even delete an entire table altogether with another command, `DROP`.
