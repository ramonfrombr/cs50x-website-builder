## Welcome

- When David was a first year, he was too intimidated to take any computer science courses. By the time he was a sophomore, he found the courage to take the equivalent of CS50, but only pass/fail.
- In fact, two-thirds of CS50 students have never taken a CS course before.
- And importantly, too:

  > what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself when you began

## What is computer science?

- Computer science is fundamentally problem-solving.
- We can think of problem-solving as the process of taking some input (details about our problem) and generate some output (the solution to our problem). The “black box” in the middle is computer science.  
  ![word "input", arrow into box, arrow out of box, word "output"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/input_output.png)
- We need a way to represent inputs, such that we can store and work with information in a standard way.

## Binary

- A computer, at the lowest level, stores data in binary, a numeral system in which there are just two digits, 0 and 1.
- When we first learned to count, we might have used one finger to represent one thing. That system is called unary. When we learned to write numbers with the digits 0 through 9, we learned to use decimal.
- For example, we know the following represents one hundred and twenty-three.

<pre>
    1 2 3
</pre>

- The `3` is in the ones column, the `2` is in the tens column, and the `1` is in the hundreds column.
- So `123` is 100×1 + 10×2 + 1×3 = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123.
- Each place for a digit represents a power of ten, since there are ten possible digits for each place.

- In binary, with just two digits, we have powers of two for each place value:

<pre>
    4 2 1
    <b>0 0 0</b>
</pre>

- This would still be equal to 0.

- Now if we change the binary value to, say, `0 1 1`, the decimal value would be 3.
<pre>
    4 2 1
    <b>0 1 1</b>
</pre>
- If we wanted to represent 8, we would need another digit:

<pre>
    8 4 2 1
    <b>1 0 0 0</b>
</pre>

- And binary makes sense for computers because we power them with electricity, which can be either on or off, so each bit only needs to be on or off. In a computer, there are millions or billions of switches called transistors that can store electricity and represent a bit by being “on” or “off”.
- With enough bits, or binary digits, computers can count to any number.
- 8 bits make up one **byte**.

## Representing data

- To represent letters, all we need to do is decide how numbers map to letters. Some humans, many years ago, collectively decided on a standard mapping called [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). The letter “A”, for example, is the number 65, and “B” is 66, and so on. The mapping also includes punctuation and other symbols. Other characters, like letters with accent marks, and emoji, are part of a standard called [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) that use more bits than ASCII to accommodate all these characters.
  - When we receive an emoji, our computer is actually just receiving a decimal number like `128514` (`11111011000000010` in binary, if you can read that more easily) that it then maps to the image of the emoji.
- An image, too, is comprised of many smaller square dots, or pixels, each of which can be represented in binary with a system called RGB, with values for red, green, and blue light in each pixel. By mixing together different amounts of each color, we can represent millions of colors:  
  ![red square labeled with 72, green square labeled with 73, blue square labeled with 33](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/rgb.png)
  - The red, green, and blue values are combined to get a light yellow color:  
    ![light yellow square](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/rgb_combined.png)
- We can see this in an emoji if we zoom in far enough: ![zoomed-in emoji of laughing tears of joy with squares of pixels distinguishable](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/emoji_zoomed.png)
- And computer programs know, based on the context of its code, whether the binary numbers should be interpreted as numbers, or letters, or pixels.
- And videos are just many, many images displayed one after another, at some number of frames per second. Music, too, can be represented by the notes being played, their duration, and their volume.
