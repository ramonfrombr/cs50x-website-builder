Algorithms Summary
• There are many different types of searching and sorting algorithms, and we’ll only skim the surface in CS50.
• Let’s see if we can’t distill each algorithm down to its core elements, so you can remember the most important information about each.

Algorithm Name
Basic Concept
O
Ω
Selection Sort
Find the smallest unsorted element in an array and swap it with the first unsorted element of that array.
n2
n2
Bubble Sort
Swap adjacent pairs of elements if they are out of order, effectively “bubbling” larger elements to the right and smaller ones to the left.
n2
n
Insertion Sort
Proceed once through the array from left-to-right, shifting elements as necessary to insert each element into its correct place.
n2
n
Merge Sort
Split the full array into subarrays, then merge those subarrays back together in the correct order.
n log n
n log n
Linear Search
Iterate across the array from left-to-right, trying to find the target element.
n
1
Binary Search
Given a sorted array, divide and conquer by systematically eliminating half of the remaining elements in the search for the target element.
log n
1
