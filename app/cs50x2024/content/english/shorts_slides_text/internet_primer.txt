Internet Primer
• We’ve reached the point in the course where we begin the transition away from the command-line oriented world of C and start considering the web-based world of PHP and the like.
• Before we dive headlong into that world, it’s a good idea to have a basic understanding of how humans and computers interact over the internet.

Internet Primer
• IP Address
• In order for your machine to uniquely identify itself on the Internet, it needs an address.
• This way, it can send information out and also receive information back to the correct location.
• The addressing scheme used by computers is known as IP addressing.

[8]

Internet Primer
• IP Address
• As originally developed, the IP addressing scheme would effectively allocate a unique 32-bit address to each device hoping to connect to the internet.
• Instead of representing these 32-bit addresses as hexadecimal, we represent them as four clusters of 8-bits using decimal notation.

• IP Address
w.x.y.z
• Each of w, x, y, and z can be a nonnegative value in the range 
[0, 255].

Internet Primer
• IP Address
• If each IP address is 32 bits, that means there are roughly 4 billion addresses to give out.
• The population of the world is somewhere in excess of 7 billion, and most folks in the western world have more than 1 device capable of Internet connectivity.
• Some workarounds have allowed us to deal with this problem (for now).

Internet Primer
• IP Address
• In recent years, we’ve been slowly phasing out this old scheme (IPv4) and replacing it with a newer scheme (IPv6) that assigns computers 128-bit addresses, instead of 32-bit addresses.

Internet Primer
• IPv6 Address
s:t:u:v:w:x:y:z
• Each of s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z is represented by 1 to 4 
hexadecimal digits in the range [0,ffff].

Internet Primer
• DHCP
• How do we get an IP address in the first place though? Surely we can’t just choose any one we want. What if the want we want is already taken?
• Somewhere between your computer and the Internet at large exists a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, whose role is to assign IP addresses to devices.

[21]

Internet Primer
• DHCP
• Prior to the widespread promulgation of DHCP, the task of assigning IP addresses fell to a system administrator, who would need to manually assign such addresses.

[24]

Internet Primer
• DNS
• Odds are, you’ve never actually tried to visit a website by typing its IP address into your browser.
• The Domain Name System (DNS) exists to help us translate IP addresses to more memorable names that are more human-comprehensible.
• In this way, DNS is somewhat like the yellow pages of the web.

[29]

Internet Primer
• DNS
• Much like there is no yellow pages of the world, there is really no DNS record of the entire internet.
• Rather, large DNS server systems (like Google’s own) are more like aggregators, collecting smaller sets of DNS information and pooling them together, updating frequently.

[30]

Internet Primer
• DNS
• In that way, large DNS servers are like libraries that stock many different sets of local yellow page books. In order to have the most up-to-date phone numbers for businesses, libraries must update the books they have on hand.
• DNS record sets are thus fairly decentralized.

[33]

Internet Primer
• Access Points
• One of the ways we’ve dealt with the IPv4 addressing problem is to start assigning multiple people to the same IP address.
• The IP address is assigned to a router, whose job it is to act as a traffic cop that allows data requests from all of the devices on your local network (your home or business, e.g.) to be processed through a single IP address.

[34]

Internet Primer
• Access Points
• Modern home networks consist of access points that combine a router, a modem, a switch, and other technologies together into a single device.
• Modern business networks or large-scale wide-area networks (WANs) still frequently have these as separate devices to allow the size of their network to scale more easily.

[37]

Internet Primer
• This isn’t a course on networking, so this is far from the whole story, but it’s enough to get us started.
• At home or at work we have local, small networks, and these networks are woven together to create a large, interconnected network—an Internet.
• If you think about each of these small networks being isolated communities with only a single road in or out, the picture becomes a bit clearer.
