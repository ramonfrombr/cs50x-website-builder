## Recap

- Over these past ten weeks, you have been drinking from the proverbial firehose.
- While in this course, you learned how to program many programming languages; indeed, our great hope is that you _learned how to program_ in all: Regardless of the programming language.
- Further, we hope that you _learned how to solve problems_ above all else.

## Looking Ahead

- As you journey from the work of this course to the world outside CS50, you may want to take a number of steps to prepare.
- To be able to execute commands on the terminal, much like you did on [CS50.dev](https://cs50.dev), you can install command-line tools on your [Mac](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [PC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).
- You can learn more about [Git](https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A).

- You can host a website using [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- You can host a web app using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/), or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/edu/students).
- You can ask questions in relevant online communities.
- You can ask questions using AI-based tools like [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
