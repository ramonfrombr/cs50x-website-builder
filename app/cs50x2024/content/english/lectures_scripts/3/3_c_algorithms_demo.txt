So toward that end, we've gone ahead and populated these lockers with a whole bunch of numbers. And the goal at hand is to solve the problem. The goal at hand is to find one of those numbers. So if we distill computer science into this problem-solving mechanism, the input today is these seven lockers. And the output is going to be a Boolean, true or false, is the number we're looking for among those seven lockers?
