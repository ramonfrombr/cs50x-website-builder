And we have a few minutes left. And we're going to spend one of them on this little teaser here, which is something that you might see typically on your typical CSI type shows. And let's motivate it as follows. If we could dim the lights for this clip. 

[VIDEO PLAYBACK] 

- --we know? 

- That at 9:15, Ray Santoya was at the ATM. 

- OK, so the question is, what was he doing at 9:16? 

- Shooting the 9 millimeter at something. Maybe he saw the sniper. 

- Or was working with him? 

[BEEPS] 

- Wait, go back one. 

- What do you see? 

[TYPING] 

[BEEPS] 

- Bring his face up, full screen. 

[BEEPS] 

- His glasses. 

- There's a reflection. 

[TYPING] 

[BEEPS] 

[CHUCKLE] 

[BEEPS] 

[LAUGHTER] 

- [INAUDIBLE] baseball team. That's their logo. 

- And he's talking to whoever's wearing that jacket. 

- We may have a witness. 

- To both shootings.

DAVID J. MALAN: So at the risk of ruining a lot of TV for you, this is not a thing. You can't just say enhance and things get enhanced. Why? Well, here's that same picture of Brian. And let's [LAUGHTER] look at this glint in his eye. Let's see what's there. If we could zoom in on this, and then zoom in on this, and then zoom in on this. This is all of the data that is in Brian's eye. There is no enhance at that point, when you're looking at just pixels represented by colors, a la Week 0. 

So what you'll do for this coming week in fact-- in fact, let's actually make this more real. If we could go back to the clip here for just 20 seconds, if we could dim the lights once more. 

[VIDEO PLAYBACK] 

- Magnify that death sphere. 

[BEEPS] 

Why is it still blurry? 

- That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer. 

- It does on CSI Miami.
