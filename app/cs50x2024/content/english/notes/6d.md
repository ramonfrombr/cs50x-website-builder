- We can improve versions of `cough`, too:

      print("cough")
      print("cough")
      print("cough")

  - We don’t need to declare a `main` function, so we just write the same line of code three times.

- But we can do better:

      for i in range(3):
          cough()

      def cough():
          print("cough")

  - Notice that we don’t need to specify the return type of a new function, which we can define with `def`.
  - But this causes an error when we try to run it: `NameError: name 'cough' is not defined`. It turns out that we need to define our function before we use it, so we can either move our definition of `cough` to the top, or create a main function:

        def main():
            for i in range(3):
                cough()

        def cough():
            print("cough")

        main()

  - Now, by the time we actually call our `main` function, the `cough` function will have been read by our interpreter.
