## Memory

- Inside our computers, we have chips called RAM, random-access memory, that stores data for short-term use. We might save a program or file to our hard drive (or SSD) for long-term storage, but when we open it, it gets copied to RAM first. Though RAM is much smaller, and temporary (until the power is turned off), it is much faster.
- We can think of bytes, stored in RAM, as though they were in a grid:

  - In reality, there are millions or billions of bytes per chip.
- In C, when we create a variable of type `char`, which will be sized one byte, it will physically be stored in one of those boxes in RAM. An integer, with 4 bytes, will take up four of those boxes.
- And each of these boxes is labeled with some number, or address, from 0, to 1, to 2, and so on.
