## Cryptography

- Similar to hashing, a cipher algorithm can use a _public key_ and text to create ciphertext.
- In turn, a _private key_ and the ciphertext can be fed to the algorithm to decrypt the text.

## Passkeys

- Passkeys are a new technology only emerging in the most recent months.
- Through private keys and a challenge being fed to an algorithm, websites can authenticate you through the unique signature created by your device.

- Hence, passwords and usernames may soon become obsolete.

## Encryption

- Encryption is a way by which data is obscured such that only the sender and intended receiver can be read.
- Early in this course, we learned a very simple algorithm to “shift” the text by one or more characters as a rudimentary form of encryption.
- _End-to-end encryption_ is a way by which encrypting and decrypting happen on the same system without a middleman. This prevents the middleman or a malicious actor from being able to snoop on your data. Zoom and Apple Messages can both utilize end-to-end encryption.

## Deletion

- Trashing a file on your computer or emptying the trash can does not actually delete the actual bits of the file on your computer.
- Instead, remnants of the files are left.

- _Secure deletion_ is where the remnants of those files are turned into zeros and ones.
- Still, some remnants may remain because of what is rendered inaccessible by the operating system.
- _Full-disk encryption_ allows your entire hard drive to be encrypted. Thus, your deleted files are less accessible to adversaries.
- Considering encryption, it’s this same technology that adversaries use to create _ransomware_ that can, quite literally, hold your hard drive for ransom.

## Summing Up

- Use a password manager.
- Use two-factor authentication.
- Use (end-to-end) encryption.
