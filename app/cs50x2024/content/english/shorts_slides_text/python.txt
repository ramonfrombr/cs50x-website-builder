Python Syntax
• Python is an example of a very commonly-used modern programming language.
• C was first released in 1972, Python in 1991.
• Python is an excellent and versatile language choice for making complex C operations much simpler.
• String manipulation
• Networking
• Fortunately, Python is heavily inspired by C (its primary interpreter, Cpython, is actually written in C) and so the syntax should be a shallow learning curve.

[2]

Python Syntax
• To start writing Python, open up a file with the .py file extension.
• Unlike a C program, which typically has to be compiled before you can run it, a Python program can be run without explicitly compiling it first.
• Important note: In CS50, we teach Python 3. (Not Python 2, which is also still fairly popular.)

[11]

Python Syntax
• Variables
• Python variables have two big differences from C.
• No type specifier.
• Declared by initialization only.
phrase = 'This is CS50'

[17]

Python Syntax
• Conditionals
• All of the old favorites from C are still available for you to use, but they look a little bit different now.
if y < 43 or z == 15:
# code goes here

[26]

Python Syntax
• Conditionals
• All of the old favorites from C are still available for you to use.
if coursenum == 50:
# code block 1
elif not coursenum == 51:
# code block 2

Python Syntax
• Conditionals
• All of the old favorites from C are still available for you to use.
char var = get_char();
bool alphabetic = isalpha(var) ? true : false;

letters_only = True if input().isalpha() else False

[40]

Python Syntax
• Loops
• Two varieties: while and for
for (int x = 0; x < 100; x += 2)
{
printf("%i\n", x);
}

[41]

Python Syntax
• Loops
• Two varieties: while and for
for x in range(0, 100, 2):
print(x)

[43]

Python Syntax
• Arrays Lists
• Here's where things really start to get a lot better than C.
• Python arrays (more appropriately known as lists) are not fixed 
in size; they can grow or shrink as needed, and you can always 
tack extra elements onto your array and splice things in and 
out easily.

[47]

Python Syntax
• Lists
• Declaring a list is pretty straightforward.
nums = list()

[51]

Python Syntax
• Lists
• Tacking on to an existing list can be done a few ways:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
nums[len(nums):] = [5]

[52]

Python Syntax
• Tuples
• Python also has a data type that is not quite like anything comparable to C, a tuple.
• Tuples are ordered, immutable sets of data; they are great for associating collections of data, sort of like a struct in C, but where those values are unlikely to change.

[57]

Python Syntax
• Tuples
• This list is iterable as well:
presidents = [
("George Washington", 1789),
("John Adams", 1797),
("Thomas Jefferson", 1801),
("James Madison", 1809)
]
for prez, year in presidents:
print("In {1}, {0} took office".format(prez, year))

presidents = [
("George Washington", 1789),
("John Adams", 1797),
("Thomas Jefferson", 1801),
("James Madison", 1809)
]
In 1789, George Washington took office
In 1797, John Adams took office                                                           
In 1801, Thomas Jefferson took office                                                     
In 1809, James Madison took office
for prez, year in presidents:
print("In {1}, {0} took office".format(prez, year))

[59]

Python Syntax
• Dictionaries
• Python also has built in support for dictionaries, allowing you 
to specify list indices with words or phrases (keys), instead of 
integers, which you were restricted to in C.

[60]

Python Syntax
• Dictionaries
pizzas = {
"cheese": 9,
"pepperoni": 10,
"vegetable": 11,
"buffalo chicken": 12    
}

[66]

Python Syntax
• Dictionaries
pizzas["cheese"] = 8
if pizza["vegetables"] < 12: 
# do something
pizzas["bacon"] = 14

[67]

Python Syntax
• Python also has built in support for dictionaries, allowing you to specify list indices with words or phrases (keys), instead of integers, which you were restricted to in C.
• But this creates a somewhat new problem… how do we iterate through a dictionary? We don't have indexes ranging from [0, n-1] anymore.

[68]

Python Syntax
• Loops (redux)
• The for loop in Python is extremely flexible!
for pie in pizzas:
# use pie in here as a stand-in for "i"

[76]

Python Syntax
• Loops (redux)
pizzas = {
"cheese": 9,
"pepperoni": 10,
"vegetable": 11,
"buffalo chicken": 12    
}
for pie, price in pizzas.items():      
print("A whole {} pizza costs ${}".format(pie, price))
A whole buffalo chicken pizza costs $12
A whole cheese pizza costs $9
A whole vegetable pizza costs $11
A whole pepperoni pizza costs $10

[80]

Python Syntax
• Printing and variable interpolation
• format gives one way to interpolate variables into our printed statements in a very printf-like way, but there are other/s.
print("A whole {} pizza costs ${}".format(pie, price))
print("A whole " + pie + " pizza costs $" + str(price))
# you may see this, but avoid; deprecated
print("A whole %s pizza costs $%2d" % (pie, price))

[81]

Python Syntax
• Functions
• Python has support for functions as well. Like variables, we don't need to specify the return type of the function (because it doesn't matter), nor the data types of any parameters (ditto).
• All functions are introduced with the def keyword.
• Also, no need for main; the interpreter reads from top to bottom!
• If you wish to define main nonetheless (and you might want to!), you must at the very end of your code have:
•
if __name__ == "__main__":
main()

[87]

Python Syntax
• Objects
• Python is an object-oriented programming language.
• An object is sort of analogous to a C structure.

[93]

Python Syntax
• Objects
• C structures contain a number of fields, which we might also call properties.
• But the properties themselves can not ever stand on their own.
struct car
{
int year;
char *model;
}
struct car herbie;
year = 1963;
model = "Beetle"; 

[94]

Python Syntax
• Objects
• C structures contain a number of fields, which we might also call properties.
• But the properties themselves can not ever stand on their own.
• Objects, meanwhile, have properties but also methods, or functions that are inherent to the object, and mean nothing outside of it. You define the methods inside the object also.
• Thus, properties and methods don’t ever stand on their own.

[96]

Python Syntax
• Objects
function(object);

[97]

Python Syntax
• Objects
object.method()

[98]

Python Syntax
• Objects
• You define a type of object using the class keyword in Python.
• Classes require an initialization function, also more-generally known as a constructor, which sets the starting values of the properties of the object.
• In defining each method of an object, self should be its first parameter, which stipulates on what object the method is 
called.

[100]

Python Syntax
• Objects
class Student():
def __init__(self, name, id):
self.name = name
self.id = id
def changeID(self, id):
self.id = id
def print(self):
print("{} – {}".format(self.name, self.id))
jane = Student("Jane", 10)
jane.print()
jane.changeID(11)
jane.print()

[101]

Python Syntax
• Style
• If you haven't noticed, good style is crucial in Python. 
• Tabs and indentation actually matter in this language, and things will not work the way you intend for them to if you disregard styling!
• Good news? No more curly braces to delineate blocks! 
• Now they just are used to declare dictionaries.


[105]

• Including files
• Just like C programs can consist of multiple files to form a single program, so can Python programs tie files together.
cs50.get_int()
cs50.get_float()
cs50.get_string()
Python Syntax

[106]

Python Syntax
• Python programs can be prewritten in .py files, but you can also write and test short Python snippets using the Python interpreter from the command line.
• All that is required is that the Python interpreter is installed on the system you wish to run your Python programs on.

[107]

Python Syntax
• To run your Python program through the Python interpreter at the command-line, simply type
python <file>
• and your program will run through the interpreter, which will execute everything inside of the file, top to bottom.

[108]

Python Syntax
• You can also make your programs look a lot more like C programs when they execute by adding a shebang to the top of your Python files, which utomatically finds and executes the interpreter for you.
#!/usr/bin/env python3
• If you do this, you need to change the permissions on your file as well using the Linux command chmod as follows:
chmod a+x <file>
