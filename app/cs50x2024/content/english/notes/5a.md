## Pointers

- Last time, we learned about pointers, `malloc`, and other useful tools for working with memory.
- Let’s review this snippet of code:

      int main(void)
      {
          int *x;
          int *y;

          x = malloc(sizeof(int));

          *x = 42;
          *y = 13;
      }

  - Here, the first two lines of code in our `main` function are declaring two pointers, `x` and `y`. Then, we allocate enough memory for an `int` with `malloc`, and stores the address returned by `malloc` into `x`.
  - With `*x = 42;`, we go to the address pointed to by `x`, and stores the value `42` into that location.
  - The final line, though, is buggy since we don’t know what the value of `y` is, since we never set a value for it. Instead, we can write:

        y = x;
        *y = 13;

    - And this will set `y` to point to the same location as `x` does, and then set that value to `13`.

- We take a look at a short clip, [Pointer Fun with Binky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uLKjb973HU), which also explains this snippet in an animated way!
