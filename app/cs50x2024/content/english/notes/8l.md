## Frameworks

- Similar to third-party libraries we can leverage in Python, there are third-party libraries called _frameworks_ that we can utilize with our HTML files.
- _Bootstrap_ is one of these frameworks that we can use to beautify our HTML and easily perfect design elements such that our pages are more readable.
- Bootstrap can be utilized by adding the following `link` tag in the `head` of your html file:

      <head>
          <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-Zenh87qX5JnK2Jl0vWa8Ck2rdkQ2Bzep5IDxbcnCeuOxjzrPF/et3URy9Bv1WTRi" crossorigin="anonymous">
          <title>favorites</title>
      </head>

- You can learn more about this in the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/).
