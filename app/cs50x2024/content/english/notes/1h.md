- Let’s implement the coughing program from week 0:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          printf("cough\n");
          printf("cough\n");
          printf("cough\n");
      }

- We could use a `for` loop:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
          {
              printf("cough\n");
          }
      }

  - By convention, programmers tend to start counting at 0, and so `i` will have the values of `0`, `1`, and `2` before stopping, for a total of three iterations. We could also write `for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)` for the same final effect.

- We can move the `printf` line to its own function:

      #include <stdio.h>

      void cough(void);

      int main(void)
      {
          for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
          {
              cough();
          }
      }

      void cough(void)
      {
          printf("cough\n");
      }

  - We declared a new function with `void cough(void);`, before our `main` function calls it. The C compiler reads our code from top to bottom, so we need to tell it that the `cough` function exists, before we use it. Then, after our `main` function, we can implement the `cough` function. This way, the compiler knows the function exists, and we can keep our `main` function close to the top.
  - And our `cough` function doesn’t take any inputs, so we have `cough(void)`.

- We can abstract `cough` further:

      #include <stdio.h>

      void cough(int n);

      int main(void)
      {
          cough(3);
      }

      void cough(int n)
      {
          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
          {
              printf("cough\n");
          }
      }

  - Now, when we want to print “cough” any number of times, we can just call the same function. Notice that, with `void cough(int n)`, we indicate that the `cough` function takes as input an `int`, which we refer to as `n`. And inside `cough`, we use `n` in our `for` loop to print “cough” the right number of times.

- Let’s look at `positive.c`:

      #include <cs50.h>
      #include <stdio.h>

      int get_positive_int(void);

      int main(void)
      {
          int i = get_positive_int();
          printf("%i\n", i);
      }

      // Prompt user for positive integer
      int get_positive_int(void)
      {
          int n;
          do
          {
              n = get_int("%s", "Positive Integer: ");
          }
          while (n < 1);
          return n;
      }

  - The CS50 library doesn’t have a `get_positive_int` function, but we can write one ourselves. Our function `int get_positive_int(void)` will prompt the user for an `int` and return that `int`, which our main function stores as `i`. In `get_positive_int`, we initialize a variable, `int n`, without assigning a value to it yet. Then, we have a new construct, `do ... while`, which does something _first_, then checks a condition, and repeats until the condition is no longer true.
  - Once the loop ends because we have an `n` that is not `< 1`, we can return it with the `return` keyword. And back in our `main` function, we can set `int i` to that value.
