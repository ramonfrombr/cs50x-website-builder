But much more arcanely than C is. But again, we don't have to care about this, because Clang does all of this for us. But once you're at that point of having assembly code, you need to get it to machine code the actual zeros and ones. And that's where Clang does what's called assembling. There's another part of Clang, like some built-in functionality, that takes as input that assembly code and converts it from this to the zeros and ones that we talked about in week 0.
