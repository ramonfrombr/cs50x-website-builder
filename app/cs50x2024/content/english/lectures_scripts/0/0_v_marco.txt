So in programming, as in Scratch here, you can do multiple things at a time sometimes with languages, such that they're both running together in parallel, if you will, or looping again. And they can somehow intercommunicate by using something like a variable. Let's look at one final example involving two different sprites, this one an old school game that you might recall growing up called Marco Polo. In this game of Marco Polo, one person yells out Marco and one or more other people yell out Polo. And the first of them is typically blindfolded, so you're trying to find that person based only on his or her voice's response. So in this program here, if I go ahead and click the green flag, notice that nothing happens yet until I hit the space bar. And we'll see that the orange puppet says Marco and the blue puppet says Polo. But how does that work? Well, here is the code for the orange puppet. Forever, he is doing the following. If the key space is pressed, that is the space bar, say Marco for two seconds, but then one other feature. And this is new. It broadcasts what's called an event. So it turns out that computers can't just see what another program or sprite is doing, but they can listen for something called an event. It's sort of a secret message from one program to another. So broadcast event is this other puzzle piece that can just say event. And now notice if I click not on the orange puppet down here, but on the blue, the blue puppet has even less code, but it is not waiting for the green flag to be clicked. Instead, it is waiting until it receives this so-called an event, a sort of invisible message from one sprite to another. And once he receives that event, it says Polo for two seconds. All right.
