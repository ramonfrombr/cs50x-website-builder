# CS50x Website Builder

This project uses ChatGPT to translate the content from Harvard University's CS50 course, and then uses Flask to build the content into a set of static files that can be hosted on Github Pages.

This program has been used to build the websites for the Portuguese, French, and Spanish versions of the course:

- [CS50x em Português](https://cs50xemportugues.github.io/)
- [CS50x en Français](https://cs50xenfrancais.github.io/)
- [CS50x en Español](https://cs50xenespanol.github.io/)

But it can be used to translate the course to any language!
