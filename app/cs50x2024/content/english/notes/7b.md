## SQL

- We’ll look at a new program in our terminal window, `sqlite3`, a command-line program that lets us use another language, SQL (pronounced like “sequel”).
- We’ll run some commands to create a new database called `favorites.db` and import our CSV file into a table called “favorites”:

      ~/ $ sqlite3 favorites.db
      SQLite version 3.22.0 2018-01-22 18:45:57
      Enter ".help" for usage hints.
      sqlite> .mode csv
      sqlite> .import "CS50 2019 - Lecture 7 - Favorite TV Shows (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv" favorites

- We see a `favorites.db` in our IDE after we run this, and now we can use SQL to interact with our data:

      sqlite> SELECT title FROM favorites;
      title
      Dynasty
      The Office
      Blindspot
      24
      Friends
      psych
      Veep
      Survivor
      ...

- We can even sort our results:

      sqlite> SELECT title FROM favorites ORDER BY title;
      title
      /
      24
      9009
      Adventure Time
      Airplane Repo
      Always Sunny
      Ancient Aliens
      ...

- And get a count of the number of times each title appears:

      sqlite> SELECT title, COUNT(title) FROM favorites GROUP BY title;
      title | COUNT(title)
      / | 1
      24 | 1
      9009 | 1
      Adventure Time | 1
      Airplane Repo | 1
      Always Sunny | 1
      Ancient Aliens | 1
      ...

- We can even set the count of each title to a new variable, `n`, and order our results by that, in descending order. Then we can see the top 10 results with `LIMIT 10`:

      sqlite> SELECT title, COUNT(title) AS n FROM favorites GROUP BY title ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 10;
      title | n
      The Office | 30
      Friends | 20
      Game of Thrones | 20
      Breaking Bad | 14
      Black Mirror | 9
      Rick and Morty | 9
      Brooklyn Nine-Nine | 5
      Game of thrones | 5
      No | 5
      Prison Break | 5
