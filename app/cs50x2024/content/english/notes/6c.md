- It turns out, even though implementing a program in Python is simpler for us, the running time of our program in Python is slower than our program in C since our interpreter has to do more work for us. So, depending on our goals, we’ll also have to consider the tradeoff of human time of writing a program that’s more efficient, versus the running time of the program.
- In Python, we can too include the CS50 library, but our syntax will be:

      from cs50 import get_string

  - Notice that we specify the functions we want to use.

- Now we can get strings from a user:

      from cs50 import get_string

      s = get_string("What's your name?:\n")
      print("hello, " + s)

- We can substitute expressions into our format strings, too:

      from cs50 import get_int

      age = get_int("What's your age?\n")
      print(f"You are at least {age * 365} days old.")

- And we can demonstrate conditions:

      from cs50 import get_int

      x = get_int("x: ")
      y = get_int("y: ")

      if x < y:
          print("x is less than y")
      elif x > y:
          print("x is greater than y")
      else:
          print("x is equal to y")

- To check conditions, we can say:

      from cs50 import get_string

      s = get_string("Do you agree?\n")

      if s == "Y" or s == "y":
          print("Agreed.")
      elif s == "N" or s == "n":
          print("Not agreed.")

  - Python doesn’t have chars, so we can check them as strings directly.
  - We can also say `if s in ["Y", "y"]:`, or `if s.lower() in ["y"]:`. It turns out that strings in Python are like structs in C, where we have not only variables but functions that we can call. For example, given a string `s`, we can call its `lower` function with `s.lower()` to get the lowercase version of the string.
