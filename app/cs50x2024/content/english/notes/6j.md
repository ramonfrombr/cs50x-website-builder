- On our own Mac or PC, we can open a terminal after installing Python, and use the microphone to convert our speech to text:

      import speech_recognition

      recognizer = speech_recognition.Recognizer()
      with speech_recognition.Microphone() as source:
          print("Say something!")
          audio = recognizer.listen(source)

      print("Google Speech Recognition thinks you said:")
      print(recognizer.recognize_google(audio))

  - It turns out that thereâ€™s another library we can download, called `speech_recognition`, that can listen to audio and convert it to a string.

- And now, we can match on the audio to print something else:

      ...
      words = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)

      # Respond to speech
      if "hello" in words:
          print("Hello to you too!")
      elif "how are you" in words:
          print("I am well, thanks!")
      elif "goodbye" in words:
          print("Goodbye to you too!")
      else:
          print("Huh?")

- We can even use regular expressions, to match on part of a string:

      ...
      words = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)

      matches = re.search("my name is (.*)", words)
      if matches:
          print(f"Hey, {matches[1]}.")
      else:
          print("Hey, you.")

  - Here, we can get all the characters after `my name is` with `.*`, and print it out.

- We run [detect.py and faces.py](https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/faces/), which finds each face (or even a specific face) in a photo.
- [qr.py](https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/qr/) will also generate a QR code to a particular URL.
