## string

- We might have a variable `string s` for a name like `EMMA`, and be able to access each character with `s[0]` and so on:  
  ![boxes side by side, containing: E labeled s[0], M labeled s[1], M labeled s[2], A labeled s[3], \0 labeled s[4]](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/s_array.png)
- But it turns out that each character is stored in memory at a byte with some address, and `s` is actually just a pointer with the address of the first character:  
  ![box containing 0x123 labeled s, boxes side by side containing E labeled 0x123, M labeled 0x124, M labeled 0x125, A labeled 0x126, \0 labeled 0x127](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/s_pointer.png)
- And since `s` is just a pointer to the beginning, only the `\0` indicates the end of the string.
- In fact, the CS50 Library defines a `string` with `typedef char *string`, which just says that we want to name a new type, `string`, as a `char *`, or a pointer to a character.
- Let’s print out a string:

      #include <cs50.h>
      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          string s = "EMMA";
          printf("%s\n", s);
      }

- This is familiar, but we can just say:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          char *s = "EMMA";
          printf("%s\n", s);
      }

  - This will also print `EMMA`.

- With `printf("%p\n", s);`, we can print `s` as its value as a pointer, like `0x42ab52`. (`printf` knows to go to the address and print the entire string when we use `%s` and pass in `s`, even though `s` only points to the first character.)
- We can also try `printf("%p\n", &s[0]);`, which is the address of the first character of `s`, and it’s exactly the same as printing `s`. And printing `&s[1]`, `&s[2]`, and `&s[3]` gets us the addresses that are the next characters in memory after `&s[0]`, like `0x42ab53`, `0x42ab54`, and `0x42ab55`, exactly one byte after another.
- And finally, if we try to `printf("%c\n", *s);`, we get a single character `E`, since we’re going to the address contained in `s`, which has the first character in the string.
- In fact, `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and `s[2]` actually map directly to `*s`, `*(s+1)`, and `*(s+2)`, since each of the next characters are just at the address of the next byte.
