Meanwhile, images or videos, things like this that you might see on the internet these days in the form of memes or anything else, are actually just images, but they're multiple images in the same file. If you've ever seen what's called an animated GIF, which this happens to be that happens to be looping, all our human eyes are seeing is one image after another after another after another really quickly, creating the illusion, therefore, of movement. But this cat is not actually moving. These are like five or 10 photographs of a cat in different positions just being looped endlessly. And that, too, is all a video is. A video is just a sequence of images flying past your eyes so quickly, we humans perceive it as actual movement. And so that's almost everything we use to represent information today in our computers. We have zeros and ones from which we get binary to which we then get decimal digits, but we can use those digits to represent, say, characters on the screen or colors on the screen and, in turn, now even the more interactive. Now what about something like music in a computer? Another type of information you might want to represent? Well, if we had a piano on the stage here, we could quantize the notes you're playing using just numbers, as well. What note you're playing, maybe it's A, B, C, D, E, F or G or some variant thereof. Maybe how long you hold the key down for, and if you hit it really hard, maybe how loud it is. So you could imagine using three values, the note, the duration, and the volume just to represent something like a piano song. [PIANO PLAYING] Might be one encoding of a song. And I might use different values if I want to play it even louder and longer. [PIANO PLAYING] And so forth. Which is to say that at the end of the day, no matter what media we use to represent information, it all reduces to zeros and ones. So once we have the ability to represent inputs, be it numbers or letters or colors or videos, now we can talk about outputs
