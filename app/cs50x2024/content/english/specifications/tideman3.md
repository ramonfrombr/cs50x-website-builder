## Understanding

Let’s take a look at `tideman.c`.

First, notice the two-dimensional array `preferences`. The integer `preferences[i][j]` will represent the number of voters who prefer candidate `i` over candidate `j`.

The file also defines another two-dimensional array, called `locked`, which will represent the candidate graph. `locked` is a boolean array, so `locked[i][j]` being `true` represents the existence of an edge pointing from candidate `i` to candidate `j`; `false` means there is no edge. (If curious, this representation of a graph is known as an “adjacency matrix”).

Next up is a `struct` called `pair`, used to represent a pair of candidates: each pair includes the `winner`’s candidate index and the `loser`’s candidate index.

The candidates themselves are stored in the array `candidates`, which is an array of `string`s representing the names of each of the candidates. There’s also an array of `pairs`, which will represent all of the pairs of candidates (for which one is preferred over the other) in the election.

The program also has two global variables: `pair_count` and `candidate_count`, representing the number of pairs and number of candidates in the arrays `pairs` and `candidates`, respectively.

Now onto `main`. Notice that after determining the number of candidates, the program loops through the `locked` graph and initially sets all of the values to `false`, which means our initial graph will have no edges in it.

Next, the program loops over all of the voters and collects their preferences in an array called `ranks` (via a call to `vote`), where `ranks[i]` is the index of the candidate who is the `i`th preference for the voter. These ranks are passed into the `record_preference` function, whose job it is to take those ranks and update the global `preferences` variable.

Once all of the votes are in, the pairs of candidates are added to the `pairs` array via a called to `add_pairs`, sorted via a call to `sort_pairs`, and locked into the graph via a call to `lock_pairs`. Finally, `print_winner` is called to print out the name of the election’s winner!

Further down in the file, you’ll see that the functions `vote`, `record_preference`, `add_pairs`,`sort_pairs`, `lock_pairs`, and `print_winner` are left blank. That’s up to you!

## Specification

Complete the implementation of `tideman.c` in such a way that it simulates a Tideman election.

- Complete the `vote` function.
  - The function takes arguments `rank`, `name`, and `ranks`. If `name` is a match for the name of a valid candidate, then you should update the `ranks` array to indicate that the voter has the candidate as their `rank` preference (where `0` is the first preference, `1` is the second preference, etc.)
  - Recall that `ranks[i]` here represents the user’s `i`th preference.
  - The function should return `true` if the rank was successfully recorded, and `false` otherwise (if, for instance, `name` is not the name of one of the candidates).
  - You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.
- Complete the `record_preferences` function.
  - The function is called once for each voter, and takes as argument the `ranks` array, (recall that `ranks[i]` is the voter’s `i`th preference, where `ranks[0]` is the first preference).
  - The function should update the global `preferences` array to add the current voter’s preferences. Recall that `preferences[i][j]` should represent the number of voters who prefer candidate `i` over candidate `j`.
  - You may assume that every voter will rank each of the candidates.
- Complete the `add_pairs` function.
  - The function should add all pairs of candidates where one candidate is preferred to the `pairs` array. A pair of candidates who are tied (one is not preferred over the other) should not be added to the array.
  - The function should update the global variable `pair_count` to be the number of pairs of candidates. (The pairs should thus all be stored between `pairs[0]` and `pairs[pair_count - 1]`, inclusive).
- Complete the `sort_pairs` function.
  - The function should sort the `pairs` array in decreasing order of strength of victory, where strength of victory is defined to be the number of voters who prefer the preferred candidate. If multiple pairs have the same strength of victory, you may assume that the order does not matter.
- Complete the `lock_pairs` function.
  - The function should create the `locked` graph, adding all edges in decreasing order of victory strength so long as the edge would not create a cycle.
- Complete the `print_winner` function.
  - The function should print out the name of the candidate who is the source of the graph. You may assume there will not be more than one source.

You should not modify anything else in `tideman.c` other than the implementations of the `vote`, `record_preferences`, `add_pairs`, `sort_pairs`, `lock_pairs`, and `print_winner` functions (and the inclusion of additional header files, if you’d like). You are permitted to add additional functions to `tideman.c`, so long as you do not change the declarations of any of the existing functions.

## How to Test

Be sure to test your code to make sure it handles…

- An election with any number of candidate (up to the `MAX` of `9`)
- Voting for a candidate by name
- Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot
- Printing the winner of the election
