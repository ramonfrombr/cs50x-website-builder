And so when you have actually received a message in a text message or an email with a capital letter A, you have just received a pattern of zeros and ones somehow, wirelessly or via wires, representing that pattern. Specifically, this pattern here, if we draw it not as light bulbs, but as zeros and ones. So it turns out there are certainly more numbers than just A's and B's and C's. We have the whole alphabet plus punctuation, thanks to a system called ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, which is just a fancy way of saying that there is a well-defined map that humans around the world agreed on years ago that looks a little something like this. So A is 65, an I is 73, and dot dot dot to both ends. So that is to say if you were to receive a message from a computer or from a friend saying 72, 73, 33, or the pattern of zeros and ones representing those digits , what message did you perhaps just receive? 72, 73, 33. Yeah. So, hi. So quite literally, if you were to text a friend, hi, they would receive a message that's essentially a pattern of zeros and ones, 72, 73, then something. It's actually not obvious from the chart what they are, but it turns out 33 was the number humans gave years ago to represent an exclamation point instead. And so any of the other punctuation symbols you might see on your keyboard, similarly have numbers that a computer would use, that all of us agreed on years ago, to represent that value.
