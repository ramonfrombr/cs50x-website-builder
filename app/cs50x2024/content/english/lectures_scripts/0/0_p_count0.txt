All right. So now that we have the ability to do something again and again, let's have something count up. For this one, let me go ahead and grab something from online. So on CS50's website, we'll always make available the examples and source code from each class. And this time, I want to go ahead and get this sheep here. So it turns out you don't have to just use a cat. You can use a sheep if you prefer. And let's see. By looking at this code first, what is this sheep going to do? When the green flag is clicked, there's this orange puzzle piece called Counter to one. What is that? That's an example of-- what might we call this? Yeah. It's called a variable. Now in algebra, we typically use x and y and z for variables. In programming, when you want to store some value in a placeholder like a variable, you typically give it more descriptive words because x, y, and z don't really tell the programmer or someone reading it what it's doing. So we call this variable Counter and we set it equal to 1. Now forever, the sheep is going to do what? It's going to say the counter for one second, it's going to then wait for one second, and then it's going to change, or add 1 to, the counter as its final step. So here we have, if you will, counting sheep whereby it will now just perpetually count up from 1 to 2 to 3. And probably, if we let this thing go, up to infinity.
