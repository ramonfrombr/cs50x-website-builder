## Files

- With the ability to use pointers, we can also open files:

      #include <cs50.h>
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <string.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          // Open file
          FILE *file = fopen("phonebook.csv", "a");

          // Get strings from user
          char *name = get_string("Name: ");
          char *number = get_string("Number: ");

          // Print (write) strings to file
          fprintf(file, "%s,%s\n", name, number);

          // Close file
          fclose(file);
      }

  - `fopen` is a new function we can use to open a file. It will return a pointer to a new type, `FILE`, that we can read from and write to. The first argument is the name of the file, and the second argument is the mode we want to open the file in (`r` for read, `w` for write, and `a` for append, or adding to).
  - After we get some strings, we can use `fprintf` to print to a file.
  - Finally, we close the file with `fclose`.

- Now we can create our own CSV files, files of comma-separated values (like a mini-spreadsheet), programmatically.
