## Swap

- We have two colored drinks, purple and green, each of which is in a cup. We want to swap the drinks between the two cups, but we can’t do that without a third cup to pour one of the drink into first.
- Now, let’s say we wanted to swap the values of two integers.

      void swap(int a, int b)
      {
          int tmp = a;
          a = b;
          b = tmp;
      }

  - With a third variable to use as temporary storage space, we can do this pretty easily, by putting `a` into `tmp`, and then `b` to `a`, and finally the original value of `a`, now in `tmp`, into `b`.

- But, if we tried to use that function in a program, we don’t see any changes:

      #include <stdio.h>

      void swap(int a, int b);

      int main(void)
      {
          int x = 1;
          int y = 2;

          printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
          swap(x, y);
          printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
      }

      void swap(int a, int b)
      {
          int tmp = a;
          a = b;
          b = tmp;
      }

  - It turns out that the `swap` function gets its own variables, `a` and `b` when they are passed in, that are copies of `x` and `y`, and so changing those values don’t change `x` and `y` in the `main` function.
