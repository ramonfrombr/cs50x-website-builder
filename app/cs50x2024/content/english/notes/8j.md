- This practice of placing the style and information all in the same location is not good practice. We could move the elements of style to the top of the file as follows:

      <!-- Demonstrates class selectors -->

      <html lang="en">
          <head>
              <style>

                  .centered
                  {
                      text-align: center;
                  }

                  .large
                  {
                      font-size: large;
                  }

                  .medium
                  {
                      font-size: medium;
                  }

                  .small
                  {
                      font-size: small;
                  }

              </style>
              <title>css</title>
          </head>
          <body class="centered">
              <header class="large">
                  John Harvard
              </header>
              <main class="medium">
                  Welcome to my home page!
              </main>
              <footer class="small">
                  Copyright &#169; John Harvard
              </footer>
          </body>
      </html>

  Notice all the style tags are placed up in the `head` in the `style` tag wrapper. Also notice that weâ€™ve assigned _classes_, called `centered`, `large`, `medium`, and `small` to our elements, and that we select those classes by placing a dot before the name, as in `.centered`
