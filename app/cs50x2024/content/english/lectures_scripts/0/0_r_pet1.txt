[CAT MEOWING] Maybe don't pet this cat. Why? Well, this time it is forever checking if I'm touching the mouse pointer. And if so, it's going to apparently play a sound roar, else it plays the sound Meow, which seems to be happening. So here we go. [CAT MEOWING] [CAT ROARING] So don't pet the cat. And so that's just a condition asking a question, a so-called Boolean expression if Touching Mouse Pointer.
