- Interestingly, we can also geolocate using JavaScript:

      <!DOCTYPE html>

      <html lang="en">
          <head>
              <title>geolocation</title>
          </head>
          <body>
              <script>

                  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
                      document.write(position.coords.latitude + ", " + position.coords.longitude);
                  });

              </script>
          </body>
      </html>

  Notice that `navigator.geolocation` is used to `getCurrentPosition`. This will not work if your computer or browser does not allow for location tracking.

- The capabilities of JavaScript are many and can be found in the [JavaScript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
