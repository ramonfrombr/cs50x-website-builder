## API

- An _application program interface_ or _API_ is a series of specifications that allow you to interface with another service. For example, we could utilize IMDB’s API to interface with their database. We might even integrate APIs for handling specific types of data downloadable from a server.
- We looked at an example called `shows`.
- Looking at `app.py`, we saw the following:

      # Searches for shows using Ajax

      from cs50 import SQL
      from flask import Flask, render_template, request

      app = Flask(__name__)

      db = SQL("sqlite:///shows.db")


      @app.route("/")
      def index():
          return render_template("index.html")


      @app.route("/search")
      def search():
          q = request.args.get("q")
          if q:
              shows = db.execute("SELECT * FROM shows WHERE title LIKE ? LIMIT 50", "%" + q + "%")
          else:
              shows = []
          return render_template("search.html", shows=shows)

  Notice that the `search` route executes a SQL query.

- Looking at `search.html`, you’ll notice that it is very simple:

      {% for show in shows %}
          <li>{{ show["title"] }}</li>
      {% endfor %}

  Notice that it provides a bulleted list.

- Finally, looking at `index.html`, notice that _AJAX_ code is utilized to power the search:

      <!DOCTYPE html>

      <html lang="en">
          <head>
              <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width">
              <title>shows</title>
          </head>
          <body>

              <input autocomplete="off" autofocus placeholder="Query" type="search">

              <ul></ul>

              <script>

                  let input = document.querySelector('input');
                  input.addEventListener('input', async function() {
                      let response = await fetch('/search?q=' + input.value);
                      let shows = await response.text();
                      document.querySelector('ul').innerHTML = shows;
                  });

              </script>

          </body>
      </html>

  Notice an event listener is utilized to dynamically query the server to provide a list that matches the title provided. This will locate the `ul` tag in the HTML and modify the web page accordingly to include the list of the matches.
