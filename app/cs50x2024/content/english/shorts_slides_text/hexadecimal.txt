Hexadecimal
• Most Western cultures use the decimal system, aka base-10, to represent numeric data.
• As we know, computers use the binary system, aka base-2, to represent numeric (and indeed all data).
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0  1

Hexadecimal
• As computer scientists, it’s useful to be able to express data the same way the computer does. 
• The problem, of course, is that trying to parse a huge chain of 0s and 1s can be quite difficult.

Hexadecimal
• The hexadecimal system, aka base-16, is a much more concise way to express the data on a computer’s system.
• Hexadecimal makes this mapping easy because a group of four binary digits (bits) is able has 16 different combinations, and each of those combinations maps to a single hexadecimal digit.
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f

Hexadecimal
• Just like binary has place values (1, 2, 4, 8…) and decimal does too (1, 10, 100, 1000…), so does hexadecimal.

Hexadecimal
• To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, group four binary digits (bits) together from right to left.
• Pad the leftmost group with extra 0 bits at the front if necessary.
• Then use the chart a few slides back or your memory to convert those bits to something a bit more concise.
