## Command-line arguments

- We’ve used programs like `make` and `clang`, which take in extra words after their name in the command line. It turns out that programs of our own, can also take in **command-line arguments**.
- In `argv.c`, we change what our `main` function looks like:

      #include <cs50.h>
      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(int argc, string argv[])
      {
          if (argc == 2)
          {
              printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
          }
          else
          {
              printf("hello, world\n");
          }
      }

  - `argc` and `argv` are two variables that our `main` function will now get, when our program is run from the command line. `argc` is the argument count, or number of arguments, and `argv` is an array of strings that are the arguments. And the first argument, `argv[0]`, is the name of our program (the first word typed, like `./hello`). In this example, we check if we have two arguments, and print out the second one if so.
  - For example, if we run `./argv David`, we’ll get `hello, David` printed, since we typed in `David` as the second word in our command.

- It turns out that we can indicate errors in our program by returning a value from our `main` function (as implied by the `int` before our `main` function). By default, our `main` function returns `0` to indicate nothing went wrong, but we can write a program to return a different value:

      #include <cs50.h>
      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(int argc, string argv[])
      {
          if (argc != 2)
          {
              printf("missing command-line argument\n");
              return 1;
          }
          printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
          return 0;
      }

  - The return value of `main` in our program is called an exit code.

- As we write more complex programs, error codes like this can help us determine what went wrong, even if it’s not visible or meaningful to the user
