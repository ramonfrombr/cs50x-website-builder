## Tracking Your Progress

### How do I know if I have completed all requirements for a certificate?

Your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) shows the result for each assignment submission for the most current version of the course. The top of your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) shows your current status in the course, showing the number of required assignments you have completed. If your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) states that you are not enrolled in the course, best to enroll and start completing the required assignments.

This course requires multiple assignments to be submitted in some weeks and only one assignment in other weeks. When you have completed requirements for a given week (as by receiving a score of 70% or higher on all required problems), the week number will be shown in green, and your progress indicator will be updated to reflect that.

Once you have scored at least a 70% on all required assignments, you will see a green banner atop that page, confirming your completion.

### What / where is the Gradebook for this course?

CS50x uses our own [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x). If you’ve never visited that link before, you’ll need to click the link to “enroll,” which really just enables your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) access! Registration with edX, whether for a free or verified certificate is required.

### Why does the [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) say that I am not enrolled?

There are many potential reasons for this. The most common reasons are as follows. First, it’s possible that you never enrolled in the course before. Second, it’s possible that you never linked your edX account to your gradebook. Best to follow the on-screen instructions in your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) to resolve this issue and enroll.

### Does this course have grades?

No. This course has numeric scores. An assignment that receives a score of 70% or higher is considered passing.

### Does my Gradebook only show if I scored high enough to pass a problem? How can I see my actual numeric grades?

Your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) will display a green check if you passed a submitted assignment and a red check if you did not pass a submitted assignment.

Your overall problem score is weighted 75% for correctness and 25% for style. In order to receive the green tick indicating completion, your overall score must be 70% or higher. As an example, if your check50 score is 7/8 and your style score is 0.95, your overall score will be (7/8 _ 0.75) + (0.95 _ 0.25) = 89%. You can click the problem name in your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) to see your individual check50 and style50 scores.

### I completed an assignment or this course in a prior year. Why does my Gradebook no longer show my prior progress?

At the start of each calendar year, we clean up our [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) and “reset” it. What happened to your progress depends on when you last submitted an assignment for the course.

### Why does edX think my grade is 0%?

This course does not use edX’s built-in gradebook, so all students’ scores always appear (in edX’s gradebook) as 0%. Not to worry, see your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) for your actual results.

### I watched all the videos in edX or on YouTube: Why don’t I have a certificate?

This course has numerous assignments that must be completed in addition to watching the course lectures. Best to see the course menu, which lists the various assignments for the course.

### Why does my edX dashboard say I can “resume” the course even though I have completed it?

Once you begin the course, on your dashboard the `View Course` button will change to `Resume Course`. This button is there for your convenience to return to the course and it doesn’t indicate completion or non-completion.

### GitHub has disabled my account. What do I do?

Best to consult GitHub’s [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement) regarding account reinstatement. We cannot transfer your past progress to a new GitHub account. Further, we cannot access your files from a disabled GitHub account. If you cannot regain access to your GitHub account, you will need to restart the course.
