- We can write a program to search for a particular title:

      import csv

      # Prompt user for title
      title = input("Title: ")

      # Open CSV file
      with open("shows2.csv", "r") as input:

          # Create DictReader
          reader = csv.DictReader(input)

          # Iterate over CSV file
          for row in reader:

              # Search for title
              if title.lower() == row["primaryTitle"].lower():
                  print(row["primaryTitle"], row["startYear"], row["genres"], sep=" | ")

  - We can run this program and see our results, but we can see how SQL can do a better job.

- In Python, we can connect to a SQL database and read our file into it once, so we can make lots of queries without writing new programs and without having to read the entire file each time.
- Letâ€™s do this more easily with the CS50 library:

      import cs50
      import csv

      # Create database by opening and closing an empty file first
      open(f"shows3.db", "w").close()
      db = cs50.SQL("sqlite:///shows3.db")

      # Create table called `shows`, and specify the columns we want,
      # all of which will be text except `startYear`
      db.execute("CREATE TABLE shows (tconst TEXT, primaryTitle TEXT, startYear NUMERIC, genres TEXT)")

      # Open TSV file
      # https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz
      with open("title.basics.tsv", "r") as titles:

          # Create DictReader
          reader = csv.DictReader(titles, delimiter="\t")

          # Iterate over TSV file
          for row in reader:

              # If non-adult TV show
              if row["titleType"] == "tvSeries" and row["isAdult"] == "0":

                  # If year not missing
                  if row["startYear"] != "\\N":

                      # If since 1970
                      startYear = int(row["startYear"])
                      if startYear >= 1970:

                          # Insert show by substituting values into each ? placeholder
                          db.execute("INSERT INTO shows (tconst, primaryTitle, startYear, genres) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)",
                                     row["tconst"], row["primaryTitle"], startYear, genres)

- Now we can run `sqlite3 shows3.db` and run commands like before, such as `SELECT * FROM shows LIMIT 10;`.
- With `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shows;` we can see that there are more than 150,000 shows in our table, and with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shows WHERE startYear = 2019;`, we see that there were more than 6000 this year.
