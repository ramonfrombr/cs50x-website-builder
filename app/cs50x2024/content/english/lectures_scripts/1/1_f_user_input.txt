All right, so let's take things up a slight notch and do something that's a little more interesting, going back to the side by side here. So thus far, all we've done is print out hello world. But recall, last week, the second program we wrote was a little more dynamic and interactive. What did we do last week as our second program in Scratch, if you recall? AUDIENCE: It prompted the user for their name. DAVID MALAN: Yeah, it prompted the user for their name. And then we said hello, David, or hello, Brian, or whoever was actually running the program. So that program looked a little something like this. These two lines of code were attached to a when green flag clicked last week. This blue block here at top was a function, and that function returned an argument, returned a response. It returned the answer that the user had typed in. And that was useful, because we then used the user's answer to join it together, or concatenate left and right, with the word hello. And then we said the result of that. So how do we do this in C? Well, this is where things are going to escalate quickly. But again, it's all going to follow certain rules and patterns that are going to get more and more familiar over time.
