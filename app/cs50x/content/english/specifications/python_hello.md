# Hello, Again

## Problem to Solve

In a file called `hello.py` in a folder called `sentimental-hello`, implement a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name, exactly as you did in [Problem Set 1](../../1/). Except that your program this time should be written in Python!

Hints

-   Recall that you can get a `str` from a user with `get_string`, which is declared in the `cs50` library.
-   Recall that you can print a `str` with `print`.
-   Recall that you can create formatted strings in Python by prepending `f` to a string itself. For example, `f"{name}"` will substitute (“interpolate”) the value of the variable `name` where you’ve written `{name}`.

## Demo

## How to Test

While `check50` is available for this problem, you’re encouraged to first test your code on your own for each of the following.

-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `David` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, David`.
-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Inno` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Inno`.
-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Kamryn` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Kamryn`.

### Correctness

### Style

    style50 hello.py

## How to Submit

    submit50 cs50/problems/2024/x/sentimental/hello

### Why does my submission pass check50, but shows “No results” in my Gradebook after running submit50?

In some cases, `submit50` may not grade the assignment due to inconsistent formatting in your `hello.py` file. To fix this issue, run `black hello.py` in the `sentimental-hello` folder. Address any issues that are revealed. Run `check50` again to ensure your submission still functions. Finally, run the `submit50` command above again. Your result will appear in your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) within a few minutes.

Please note that if there is a numerical score next to your hello submission in the `submissions` area of your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x), the procedure discussed above does not apply to you. Likely, you have not fully addressed the requirements of the problem set and should rely upon `check50` for clues as to what work remains.
