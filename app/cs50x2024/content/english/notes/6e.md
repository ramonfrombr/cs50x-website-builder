- Our functions can take inputs, too:

      def main():
          cough(3)

      def cough(n):
          for i in range(n):
              print("cough")

      main()

- We can define a function to get a positive integer:

      from cs50 import get_int

      def main():
          i = get_positive_int()
          print(i)

      def get_positive_int():
          while True:
              n = get_int("Positive Integer: ")
              if n > 0:
                  break
          return n

      main()

  - Since there is no do-while loop in Python as there is in C, we have a `while` loop that will go on infinitely, but we use `break` to end the loop as soon as `n > 0`. Then, our function will just `return n`.
  - Notice that variables in Python have function scope by default, meaning that `n` can be initialized within a loop, but still be accessible later in the function.

- We can print out a row of question marks on the screen:

      for i in range(4):
          print("?", end="")
      print()

  - When we print each block, we donâ€™t want the automatic new line, so we can pass a parameter, or named argument, to the `print` function. Here, we say `end=""` to specify that nothing should be printed at the end of our string. Then, after we print our row, we can call `print` to get a new line.
