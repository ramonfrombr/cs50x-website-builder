So at the end of the day, while this is a very large physical incarnation of the notion of binary, that's all that's going on inside of our computers every day when they represent information. But we only, thus far, have the ability to represent numbers, it seems. So how then does a computer allow you to send text messages and emails and compose documents and so forth? We need to all agree how we're going to go about representing characters or letters of an alphabet, be it English or something else, instead. And any intuition for how, if a computer only has millions or billions of switches that can be turned on and off, thereby representing numbers, we could possibly go about representing something other than numbers, like the letter A? Say it again? By a digit. So we maybe just need to agree as a group, you know what? Let's all agree that the letter A, in the context of a word processing program or a text message or email, just needs to be represented by a number, and we all need to agree what that number is. So maybe super simply, let's just say A is 1, B is 2, C is 3 and so forth. And you could imagine then having a computer turn on lots of little transistors to represent A and B and C, so long as the software on that computer, as we'll see, knows that it's a word processing program and not, say, a calculator or something that's meant to use numbers alone. So it turns out that computers don't actually use the number 1 for A or 2 for B. It's a little bigger than that. The world decided decades ago that the capital letter A is going to be represented by the number 65. 65, which is to say, if you have a byte of information in the computer, and this is the ones place, twos, four, eight, 16, 32, 64. If a computer were to store the capital letter A using eight bits or switches, it would just turn on those two, the 64s place and the ones place.
