And for this, rather than me play it, let me invite one other volunteer to come on up who's got to be-- OK, I see your hand here. What's your name? MEGAN: Megan. DAVID MALAN: Megan. All right, Megan, we have a game for you called-- maybe I mentioned this-- [? IB's ?] hardest game. OK, come on up. Nice to meet you. This is a game by one of your former predecessors, who their problems said zero, implemented this. You'll see the instructions in just a moment on the screen. We'll see if we can't inspire some folks to root for you here. And after this, as is the tradition in CS50, we will adjourn for some cake. So Megan, we have here for you, [? IB's ?] hardest game. I'm going to go ahead and maximize the window. I'm going to go ahead and click Begin and we'll see the instructions. MEGAN: OK. DAVID MALAN: Good luck. MEGAN: Thanks. [MUSIC -MC HAMMER, "U CAN'T TOUCH THIS"] DAVID MALAN: Let's go ahead and raise the volume. Here we go. [MUSIC -MC HAMMER, "U CAN'T TOUCH THIS"] (SINGING) Can't touch this. DAVID MALAN: So you're going to move the arrow keys and navigate your way, essentially-- oh, yep-- through a maze. Notice Megan's not able to go beyond the black borders because if touching edge, logic. Now when you touch the other sprite, you advance to the next level. Two sprites now. Another Yale icon. (SINGING) From the Oaktown and I'm known as such. And this is a beat you can't touch. I told you, homeboy. DAVID MALAN: Nice. OK. [LAUGHTER] (SINGING) Yeah, that's how we living and you know. Can't touch this. Look in my eyes, man. DAVID MALAN: Nice. (SINGING) Yo, let me but the funky lyrics. Can't touch this. [LAUGHTER] DAVID MALAN: Nice. [AUDIENCE GASPING] [APPLAUSE] (SINGING) Cold on a mission, so pull them on back. Let them know that you're too much and this is a beat, uh, they can't touch. Yo, I told you. [LAUGHTER] Why you standing there, man? Can't touch this. Yo, sounds the bells. School is in, sucker. Can't touch this. DAVID MALAN: OK. Good. Nice. [AUDIENCE GASPING] [LAUGHTER] (SINGING) Or a tape to learn what's it going to take? And now he's going to burn the charts. DAVID MALAN: Oh! (SINGING) And you might as well quit. That's word because you know-- DAVID MALAN: No! That's OK. Oh. It's OK. Nice. Ah! [INAUDIBLE] Oh! Couple more lives. Nice. Oh! [AUDIENCE GASPING] OK. Yeah, you got it. MEGAN: Yes. Yep. Oh my God. DAVID MALAN: All right. One more life-- two more lives! Three more lives! Come on. (SINGING) Bring the bill. School's back in. Break it down. DAVID MALAN: Yes! [APPLAUSE] MEGAN: Up, up, up. (SINGING) Stop. Hammer time. DAVID MALAN: All right. Last life. Last life. Go, go! Here we go. All right. Nice, nice. Yes, yes. Ah! All right. A round of applause for Megan, if we could. Check her out. Here you go. [APPLAUSE] This, then, is CS50. Welcome aboard. Cake is now served.
