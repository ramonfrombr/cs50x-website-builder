## Merge sort

- We can take the idea of recusion to sorting, with another algorithm called merge sort. The pseudocode might look like:

      If only one item
        Return
      Else
          Sort left half of items
          Sort right half of items
          Merge sorted halves

- We’ll best see this in practice with an unsorted list:

      7 4 5 2 6 3 8 1

- First, we’ll sort the left half (the first four elements):

      7 4 5 2 | 6 3 8 1
      – – – –

- Well, to sort that, we need to sort the left half of the left half first:

      7 4 | 5 2 | 6 3 8 1
      – –

- Now, we have just one item, `7`, in the left half, and one item, `4`, in the right half. So we’ll merge that together, by taking the smallest item from each list first:

      – – | 5 2 | 6 3 8 1
      4 7

- And now we go back to the right half of the left half, and sort it:

      – – | – – | 6 3 8 1
      4 7 | 2 5

- Now, both halves of the left half are sorted, so we can merge the two of them together. We look at the start of each list, and take `2` since it’s smaller than `4`. Then, we take `4`, since it’s now the smallest item at the front of both lists. Then, we take `5`, and finally, `7`, to get:

      – – – – | 6 3 8 1
      – – – –
      2 4 5 7

- We now sort the right half the same way. First, the left half of the right half:

      – – – – | – – | 8 1
      – – – – | 3 6 |
      2 4 5 7

- Then, the right half of the right half:

      – – – – | – – | – –
      – – – – | 3 6 | 1 8
      2 4 5 7

- We can merge the right half together now:

      – – – – | – – – –
      – – – – | – – – –
      2 4 5 7 | 1 3 6 8
