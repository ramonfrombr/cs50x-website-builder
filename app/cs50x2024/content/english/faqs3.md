## Signing Up

### How do I sign up for the course?

You can sign up by following the instructions on the [course page](..).

### What’s the difference between a verified certificate and a CS50 Certificate?

A [verified certificate](https://www.edx.org/verified-certificate), which you can purchase from edX, “can provide proof for an employer, school, or other institution that you have successfully completed an online course.”

A [CS50 Certificate](../certificate/) is a free certificate from CS50 itself.

### If I sign up for a verified certificate, can I also get a free certificate?

Yes.

### Is edX registration required?

Yes. Regardless if you are pursuing a free or verified certificate, you must register with edX.

### edX is requiring me to pay to register for the course: How do I get a free certificate?

Best to carefully re-read edX’s questions on their website as you register. There is a “free” or “audit” option which requires no payment.

### If I want an edX verified certificate in the future, do I have to pay for verification before starting the course?

Nope! If you would like a verified certificate from edX, you can pay for verification at any point up until 10 days before the course’s final deadline, even after completing all of the coursework. However, we strongly recommend, to avoid any logistical issues that can delay certificate issuance, that you verify before finishing the course. Otherwise, the 30-day wait we reference [below](#how-do-i-get-my-verified-certificate-from-edx) only starts once you have had your identity verified by edX. Thus, waiting to register for a verified certificate after you complete the course can cause delays of receiving your certificate for 30 days or more.

### If I paid for a verified certificate after I completed the course, do I need to tell you?

No. As long as your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) shows that you have completed the course, you will receive your certificate up to 30 days after your identity is verified by edX.

### If I paid for a verified certificate before this calendar year, do I need to pay again?

No, your verification should be good for an entire year, but if it has expired, you should be able to re-verify yourself via edX’s [dashboard](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard).
