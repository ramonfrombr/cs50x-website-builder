## POST

- You can imagine scenarios where it is not safe to utilize `get`, as usernames and passwords would show up in the URL.
- We can utilize the method `post` to help with this problem by modifying `app.py` as follows:

      # Switches to POST

      from flask import Flask, render_template, request

      app = Flask(__name__)


      @app.route("/")
      def index():
          return render_template("index.html")


      @app.route("/greet", methods=["POST"])
      def greet():
          return render_template("greet.html", name=request.form.get("name", "world"))

  Notice that `POST` is added to the `/greet` route, and that we use `request.form.get` rather than `request.args.get`.

- This tells the server to look _deeper_ in the virtual envelope and not reveal the items in `post` in the URL.
- Still, this code can be advanced further by utilizing a single route for both `get` and `post`. To do this, modify `app.py` as follows:

      # Uses a single route

      from flask import Flask, render_template, request

      app = Flask(__name__)


      @app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
      def index():
          if request.method == "POST":
              return render_template("greet.html", name=request.form.get("name", "world"))
          return render_template("index.html")

  Notice that both `get` and `post` are done in a single routing. However, `request.method` is utilized to properly route based upon the type of routing requested by the user.
