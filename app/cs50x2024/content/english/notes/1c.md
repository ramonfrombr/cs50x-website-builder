## Compilers

- Once we save the code that we wrote, which is called **source code**, we need to convert it to **machine code**, binary instructions that the computer understands directly.
- We use a program called a **compiler** to compile our source code into machine code.
- To do this, we use the **Terminal** panel, which has a **command prompt**. The `$` at the left is a prompt, after which we can type commands.
  - We type `clang hello.c` (where `clang` stands for “C languages”, a compiler written by a group of people). But before we press enter, we click the folder icon on the top left of CS50 Sandbox. We see our file, `hello.c`. So we press enter in the terminal window, and see that we have another file now, called `a.out` (short for “assembly output”). Inside that file is the code for our program, in binary. Now, we can type `./a.out` in the terminal prompt to run the program `a.out` in our current folder. We just wrote, compiled, and ran our first program!
