1 By _completed_, we mean you earned a score of 70% or better on the problem before 1 January 2024.

### Will the work I complete for CS50x 2024 (or prior) carry forward into CS50x 2025?

For CS50x 2025, work completed in CS50x 2023 or prior is **not** subject to carry-forward for progress. Only work completed in CS50x 2024 will carry forward. This means if you received a credit for past work that carried forward into CS50x 2024, that credit will no longer be valid as of 1 January 2025, and you may need to redo (or at least resubmit!) some assignments. What this effectively means is that, depending on when in the calendar year you begin, you have between 12 and 24 months to complete CS50x without needing to circle back and start resubmitting assignments. We know, particularly for folks who are trying to finish the course right at the end of December, that this can prove difficult, but unfortunately, we cannot make any exceptions to this rule for any reason. We therefore encourage you, if possible, to avoid trying to rush to complete the course at the deadline and instead spread your studies out over a reasonable stretch of time.

### Will the work I complete for CS50x 2024 carry forward into CS50x 2025?

Yes. However, details about how your work will carry over is pending. Check a back in November or December 2024 for more details.
