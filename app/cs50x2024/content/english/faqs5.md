## Problem Sets, Assignments, and Assessments

### Does this course have a test?

This course does not have a summative test or “final.” While our courses at Harvard College and Harvard Extension often have final tests, this course does not. You need only complete the assignments listed in each week or module of the course.

### What’s the difference between “less comfortable” and “more comfortable” problems? Do I have to do both?

In some earlier problem sets, you’ll have a choice between a “less comfortable” and a “more comfortable” problem.

The “less comfortable” problems are what you might consider the “standard” version of the problem, designed for students who have little or no prior experience. The “more comfortable” problems are the “challenge” version, designed for students who consider themselves more comfortable due to prior study/experience before this class. As such, they may require more concepts than have been covered in the course so far.

If you find yourself really struggling with the “more comfortable” version, you should switch to the “less” version (or if you’ve already completed that, simply move on and perhaps revisit in a later week). It would be better for you to skip the problem than to become so frustrated as to drop out of the course entirely. For reference, in the Fall 2019 Harvard class, only 20-30% of students submitted the “more comfortable” problems.

You don’t get any extra points for doing the “more comfortable” problems. If you submit both, the one with the highest grade will count towards your overall course progress.

### Did you get my submission?

Once you execute the `submit50` command with the appropriate _slug_ as instructed by the assignment specification, your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) will be immediately updated with your passing status, provided that your submission was passing! Before using `submit50`, best to use `check50` to make sure you have completed the entire problem before submission.

### I submitted a project, but nothing is showing up in my Gradebook yet showing that I’ve submitted. Why?

Provided that you have executed the `submit50` command with the appropriate slug as instructed by the assignment specification, your passing status should immediately posted to your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x). First, best to run `check50` on your assignment to ensure it fulfills the requirements. Second, if that still does not work, ensure that the GitHub username you are using to login into [CS50.dev](https://cs50.dev) is the same GitHub username that appears at the top of your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x).

### If I submitted a problem and did not reach the 70% passing grade, can I resubmit?

Yes! You may resubmit; we will only count your most recent submission towards your progress. See the Grades section below for more details.

### If my check50 score is not as expected, why might that be?

Your check50 score is accurate. After running check50, note that a URL will be provided linking you to your results. Note that check50 will look for precise fulfillment of the checks. Hence, if it is expecting a line break after an output and no such line break exists, the check will show as unfulfilled. In some cases, the expected and actual output may look exactly the same in the check50 results. In such an instance, best to consider how spaces and other non-visible characters may be at play. Of course, it’s also possible that you have misunderstood a portion of the assignment and need to re-read the problem set specification.

### If my style score is not as expected, why might that be?

Your style grade will be based on the style50 results for every source code file in your submission. When you run submit50, be sure that your folder includes only those files that are necessary for the problem set. If you have any extra test files in there, those will be counted towards your grade. Remove the extra files from the folder and resubmit to get an updated Style score.

### Why did I not pass my final project?

After submitting your final project, you can view your submission in your [Gradebook](https://cs50.me/cs50x) to learn details about your score and why you did not pass.

The most common reason for not receiving a passing score on your final project is that you have not followed the [Final Project Specification](../project/).

The second most common reason for not receiving a passing score on your final project relates to your documentation (your final project’s README or DESIGN file). When your README or DESIGN documentation do not fulfill the stated requirements, you will not pass the final project. The documentation file should be quite robust. Students that don’t complete a robust documentation file, including MANY paragraphs will not receive a passing grade. You are highly advised to create a robust documentation file, including the precise sections mentioned by the [Final Project Specification](../project/). Further, note that the [Final Project Specification](../project/) includes a rough word count for your documentation. Following these specifications, will ensure that your documentation file includes all the details required for you to be able to pass.

### If I did 70% of the problems, do I get a certificate?

No. You must do all the required assignments and receive at least a score of 70% on each.

### Am I cheating?

Best to refer to our [Academic Honesty](../honesty/) policy to see.
