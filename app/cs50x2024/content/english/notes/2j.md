## Readability

- Now that we know how to work with strings in our programs, we can analyze paragraphs of text for their level of readability, based on factors like how long and complicated the words and sentences are.

## Encryption

- If we wanted to send a message to someone, we might want to **encrypt**, or somehow scramble that message so that it would be hard for others to read. The original message, or input to our algorithm, is called **plaintext**, and the encrypted message, or output, is called **ciphertext**.
- A message like `HI!` could be converted to ASCII, `72 73 33`. But anyone would be able to convert that back to letters.
- An encryption algorithm generally requires another input, in addition to the plaintext. A **key** is needed, and sometimes it is simply a number, that is kept secret. With the key, plaintext can be converted, via some algorith, to ciphertext, and vice versa.
- For example, if we wanted to send a message like `I L O V E Y O U`, we can first convert it to ASCII: `73 76 79 86 69 89 79 85`. Then, we can encrypt it with a key of just `1` and a simple algorithm, where we just add the key to each value: `74 77 80 87 70 90 80 86`. Then, someone converting that ASCII back to text will see `J M P W F Z P V`. To decrypt this, someone will need to know the key.
- Weâ€™ll apply these concepts in our problem set!
