HTML
• HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a fundamental component of every website.
• HTML is a language, but it is not a programming language. It lacks concepts of variables, logic, functions, and the like.
• Rather, it is a markup language, using angle-bracket enclosed tags to semantically define the structure of a web page, causing the plain text inside of sets of tags to be interpreted by web browsers in different ways.

HTML
• Notice how the markup allows us to convey extra information about the text we’ve written.
• There are over 100 HTML tags, and lots of great resources online to find them. We won’t cover them all here.
• Another interesting way to learn about HTML tags is to view the source of a website you frequent by opening up your browser of choice’s developer tools.

HTML
• Common HTML tags
• <a href=X>, </a>
• Creates a hyperlink to web page X, with the text between the tags rendered and functional as the link text.
• <img src=X ... />
• Another self-closing tag for displaying an image located at X, with possible additional attributes (such as specifying width and height).

HTML
• Common HTML tags
• <!--, -->
• Demarcate the beginning and end of an HTML comment.
• Beyond the tags as explained here, each can also have multiple attributes that slightly modify the tag.
• For example, you can usually add an id=X attribute, to uniquely identify a tag within an overall page.

HTML
• It is important that the HTML you write be well-formed. Every tag you open should be closed (unless it is a self-closing tag), and tags should be closed in reverse order of when they were opened.
• Unlike C, your HTML will not necessarily fail with syntax errors if not well-formed, so it’s up to you to be vigilant.
• Because it can be an arduous task to investigate this, be sure to use online HTML validators to help!
