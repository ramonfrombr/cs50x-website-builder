Now what can we actually use that information for? Well it turns out what we'll be doing now, this coming week and beyond, is exploring a number of features here of what's called file I/O. Long story short, if you've ever wondered really what an image is-- we talked briefly about this in Week 0 --this is an image. But it's in binary, 0s and 1s. Does anyone know what this image is of? 

AUDIENCE: A smiley face. 

DAVID J. MALAN: Well, how did you-- are a nonzero number of you looking ahead on the slides? Because yes, it's a smiley face. And you would only know this by assuming that 1 represents a white pixel, 0 represents a black pixel, and if we effectively have a grid of bits-- 1's and 0's --this from far back kind of looks like the simplest possible smiley face. So that's an image, or a bitmap, a map of bits, that represent the pixels in an image. 

So with problem set four, what we're going to start to do is explore the world of forensics, first and foremost.
