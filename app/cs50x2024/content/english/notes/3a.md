## Searching

- Last time, we talked about memory in a computer, or RAM, and how our data can be stored as individual variables or as arrays of many items, or elements.
- We can think of an array with a number of items as a row of lockers, where a computer can only open one locker to look at an item, one at a time.
- For example, if we want to check whether a number is in an array, with an algorithm that took in an array as input and produce a boolean as a result, we might:
  - look in each locker, or at each element, one at a time, from the beginning to the end.
    - This is called **linear search**, where we move in a line, since our array isn’t sorted.
  - start in the middle and move left or right depending on what we’re looking for, if our array of items is sorted.
    - This is called **binary search**, since we can divide our problem in two with each step, like what David did with the phone book in week 0.
- We might write pseudocode for linear search with:

      For i from 0 to n–1
          If i'th element is 50
              Return true
      Return false

  - We can label each of `n` lockers from `0` to `n–1`, and check each of them in order.

- For binary search, our algorithm might look like:

      If no items
          Return false
      If middle item is 50
          Return true
      Else if 50 < middle item
          Search left half
      Else if 50 > middle item
          Search right half

  - Eventually, we won’t have any parts of the array left (if the item we want wasn’t in it), so we can return `false`.
  - Otherwise, we can search each half depending on the value of the middle item.
