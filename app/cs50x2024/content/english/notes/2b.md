## Debugging

- Bugs are mistakes in programs that we didn’t intend to make. And debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs.

## help50 and printf

- Let’s say we wrote this program, `buggy0.c`:

      int main(void)
      {
          printf("hello, world\n");
      }

  - We see an error (in red), when we try to `make` this program, that we are `implicitly declaring library function 'printf'`. We don’t really understand this, so we can run `help50 make buggy0`, which will tell us, at the end, that we might have forgotten to write `#include <stdio.h>`, which contains `printf`.

- We can try this again with `buggy1.c`:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          string name = get_string("What's your name?\n");
          printf("hello, %s\n", name);
      }

  - We see a lot of errors, and even the first one doesn’t seem to make much sense. So we can again run `help50 make buggy1`, which will hint to us that we need `cs50.h` since `string` isn’t defined.

- To clear the terminal window (so that we can see just the output of whatever we want to run next), we can press `control + L`, or type in `clear` as a command to the terminal window.
- Let’s look at `buggy2.c`:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)
          {
              printf("#\n");
          }
      }

  - Hmm, we intended to only see 10 `#`s, but there are 11. If we didn’t know what the problem is (since our program is compiling without any errors, and we now have a logical error), we could add another print line to help us:

        #include <stdio.h>

        int main(void)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)
            {
                printf("i is now %i: ", i);
                printf("#\n");
            }
        }

  - Now, we see that `i` started at 0 and continued until it was 10, but we should have it stop once it’s at 10, with `i < 10` instead of `i <= 10`.
