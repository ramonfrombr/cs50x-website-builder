## Pointers

- We might create a value `n`, and print it out:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          int n = 50;
          printf("%i\n", n);
      }

- In our computer’s memory, there are now 4 bytes somewhere that have the binary value of 50, labeled `n`:  
  ![grid representing bytes, with four boxes together containing 50 with small n underneath](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/n.png)
- It turns out that, with the billions of bytes in memory, those bytes for the variable `n` starts at some unique address that might look like `0x12345678`.
- In C, we can actually see the address with the `&` operator, which means “get the address of this variable”:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          int n = 50;
          printf("%p\n", &n);
      }

  - And in the CS50 IDE, we might see an address like `0x7ffe00b3adbc`, where this is a specific location in the server’s memory.

- The address of a variable is called a **pointer**, which we can think of as a value that “points” to a location in memory. The `*` operator lets us “go to” the location that a pointer is pointing to.
- For example, we can print `*&n`, where we “go to” the address of `n`, and that will print out the value of `n`, `50`, since that’s the value at the address of `n`:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          int n = 50;
          printf("%i\n", *&n);
      }

- We also have to use the `*` operator (in an unfortunately confusing way) to declare a variable that we want to be a pointer:

      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
         int n = 50;
         int *p = &n;
         printf("%p\n", p);
      }

  - Here, we use `int *p` to declare a variable, `p`, that has the type of `*`, a pointer, to a value of type `int`, an integer. Then, we can print its value (something like `0x12345678`), or print the value at its location with `printf("%i\n", *p);`.

- In our computer’s memory, the variables might look like this:  
  ![grid representing bytes, with four boxes together containing 50 with small 0x12345678 underneath, and eight boxes together containing 0x12345678 with small p underneath](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/p.png)
  - We have a pointer, `p`, with the address of some variable.
- We can abstract away the actual value of the addresses now, since they’ll be different as we declare variables in our programs, and simply think of `p` as “pointing at” some value:  
  ![one box containing p pointing at smaller box containing 50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/4/pointing.png)
- Let’s say we have a mailbox labeled “123”, with the number “50” inside it. The mailbox would be `int n`, since it stores an integer. We might have another mailbox with the address “456”, inside of which is the value “123”, which is the address of our other mailbox. This would be `int *p`, since it’s a pointer to an integer.
- With the ability to use pointers, we can create different data structures, or different ways to organize data in memory that we’ll see next week.
- Many modern computer systems are “64-bit”, meaning that they use 64 bits to address memory, so a pointer will be 8 bytes, twice as big as an integer of 4 bytes.
