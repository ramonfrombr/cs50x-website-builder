## More data structures

- A **tree** is another data structure where each node points to two other nodes, one to the left (with a smaller value) and one to the right (with a larger value):  
  ![tree with node 4 at top center, left arrow to 3 below, right arrow to 6 below; 2 has left arrow to 1 below, right arrow to 3 below; 6 has left arrow to 5 below, right arrow to 7 below](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/5/binary_search_tree.png)
  - Notice that there are now two dimensions to this data structure, where some nodes are on different “levels” than others. And we can imagine implementing this with a more complex version of a node in a linked list, where each node has not one but two pointers, one to the value in the “middle of the left half” and one to the value in the “middle of the right half”. And all elements to the left of a node are smaller, and all elemnts to the right are greater.
  - This is called a binary search tree because each node has at most two children, or nodes it is pointing to, and a search tree because it’s sorted in a way that allows us to search correctly.
  - And like a linked list, we’ll want to keep a pointer to just the beginning of the list, but in this case we want to point to the root, or top center node of the tree (the 4).
- Now, we can easily do binary search, and since each node is pointing to another, we can also insert nodes into the tree without moving all of them around as we would have to in an array. Recursively searching this tree would look something like:

      typedef struct node
      {
          int number;
          struct node *left;
          struct node *right;
      } node;

      // Here, *tree is a pointer to the root of our tree.
      bool search(node *tree)
      {
          // We need a base case, if the current tree (or part of the tree) is NULL,
          // to return false:
          if (tree == NULL)
          {
              return false;
          }
          // Now, depending on if the number in the current node is bigger or smaller,
          // we can just look at the left or right side of the tree:
          else if (50 < tree->number)
          {
              return search(tree->left);
          }
          else if (50 > tree->number)
          {
              return search(tree->right);
          }
          // Otherwise, the number must be equal to what we're looking for:
          else {
              return true;
          }
      }
