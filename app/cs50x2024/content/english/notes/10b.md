## Cybersecurity

- Today will be a high-level overview of some of the cybersecurity-related topics.
- Cybersecurity is understanding how our data is _secure_ or _not secure_.

## Passwords

- One cybersecurity concern relates to our passwords.
- Passwords are one method used to secure data online.
- There are common passwords that people use:

      1. 123456
      2. admin
      3. 12345678
      4. 123456789
      5. 1234
      6. 12345
      7. password
      8. 123
      9. Aa123456
      10. 1234567890

- If you have one of the passwords above, most likely, millions of people have the same password as you!
- Adversaries in the world will start with this list.
- Bad guys can also guess most of the heuristics you use to add symbols to your password.
- Adversaries can use _brute-force attacks_, using a dictionary of passwords to simply try every possible password.
- Your password is likely not as secure as you think it is.
