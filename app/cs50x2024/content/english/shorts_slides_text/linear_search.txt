Linear Search
• In linear search, the idea of the algorithm is to iterate across the array from left to right, searching for a specified element.
In pseudocode:
• Repeat, starting at the first element:
• If the first element is what you’re looking for (the target), stop.
• Otherwise, move to the next element.

Linear Search
• Worst-case scenario: We have to look through the entire array of n elements, either because the target element is the last element of the array or doesn’t exist in the array at all.
• Best-case scenario: The target element is the first element of the array, and so we can stop looking immediately after we start.
