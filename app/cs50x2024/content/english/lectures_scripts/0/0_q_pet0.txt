So once we have the ability now to do variables, what if we start to make our programs more interactive and start to remember information? Let me go ahead and into our examples from before, and grab another example here now instead. I'm going to go back to what's called a Studio in Scratch, where all of these examples currently are. And I'm going to go and open up an example called pet 0. Computer scientists typically start counting from zero because that's symbolic of all of the light bulbs being off. And so here's a program now that if I hit Play does not seem to do anything at first, but notice as I move my cursor over-- [CAT MEOWING] --I'm kind of petting the cat now, if you will. So how is this working? Well, he, too, is just forever listening or waiting for something to happen. It's forever doing this if Touching Mouse Pointer then Play Sound Meow until done. So now the cat is being responsive to the user input not following my cursor, but responding just if I'm actually hovering over him.
