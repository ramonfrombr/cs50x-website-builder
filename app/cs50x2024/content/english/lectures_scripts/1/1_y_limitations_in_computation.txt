But before we tease you with that, let's just consider now that there are a bunch of little assumptions I've been making. Like thus far, all of the mistakes in my code have been my own-- some intentional, but several unintentional, as well, today. But it turns out that computers themselves do have limitations. Inside of your Mac or PC is generally stuff like this. This is called memory, or RAM. And you don't typically see it unless you remove the cover from your phone or your laptop or desktop. RAM is where all of your programs are stored while they're running. RAM is where all of your programs-- where all of your files are stored while they're open. It's what your computer uses to do multiple things at once and keep things in memory. However, it is, by nature of hardware, finite. You have maybe one gigabyte, one billion bytes, of memory. Maybe you have four gigabytes, or four billion bytes, of memory. You have fixed amount of memory in your computer, which means there is some fundamental limitation on what your computer can do. It cannot necessarily count to infinity, because how could it count to infinity if it can't store all possible numbers using a finite amount of space? Indeed, there are some limits of computation that we've only just begun to see.
