Selection Sort
• In selection sort, the idea of the algorithm is to find the smallest unsorted element and add it to the end of the sorted list.
In pseudocode:
• Repeat until no unsorted elements remain:
• Search the unsorted part of the data to find the smallest value
• Swap the smallest found value with the first element of the unsorted part

Selection Sort
• Worst-case scenario: We have to iterate over each of the n elements of the array (to find the smallest unsorted element) and we must repeat this process n times, since only one element gets sorted on each pass.
• Best-case scenario: Exactly the same! There’s no way to guarantee the array is sorted until we go through this process for all the elements.
