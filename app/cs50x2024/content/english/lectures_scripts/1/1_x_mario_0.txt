All right, well let's go ahead now and make this a little more user friendly. Let me go ahead and pull up some examples here of some screens that might look familiar. So if I go ahead and open up, for instance, this slide here, you might recall this game from yesteryear, Super Mario Brothers 1, from the very original Nintendo. And there's some screens in that game that look a little something like this. For instance, these are little bricks in the air that if Mario or Luigi hits their head up against, like a coin or something else pops out. But this is kind of a nice idea, because it lends itself to actually doing something a little programmatically. For instance, how might I go about writing a program that quite simply prints out four question marks? Well, let me go ahead and open up, for instance, in code, an example called mario0.c. And I claim that this could be one way of implementing this program. It's very simple, and it really doesn't do justice to the other graphics on the screen, but it does implement that one idea. And indeed, somewhere in the code for Mario, there was probably some line of code that told the console game to print question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark. In C, we could certainly do this with four question marks. Or how else could we do something that many times? AUDIENCE: For loop. DAVID MALAN: Something like a for loop.
