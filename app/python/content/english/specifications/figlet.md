# Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters

[FIGlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIGlet), named after [Frank, Ian, and Glen’s letters](http://www.figlet.org/faq.html), is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art):

     _ _ _          _   _     _
    | (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
    | | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
    | | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
    |_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/

Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at [figlet.org/examples.html](http://www.figlet.org/examples.html).

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/).

In a file called `figlet.py`, implement a program that:

- Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
  - Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
  - Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be `-f` or `--font`, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
- Prompts the user for a `str` of text.
- Outputs that text in the desired font.

If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not `-f` or `--font` or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via `sys.exit` with an error message.

Hints

- You can install `pyfiglet` with:

      pip install pyfiglet

- The documentation for pyfiglet isn’t very clear, but you can use the module as follows:

      from pyfiglet import Figlet

      figlet = Figlet()

  You can then get a `list` of available fonts with code like this:

      figlet.getFonts()

  You can set the font with code like this, wherein `f` is the font’s name as a `str`:

      figlet.setFont(font=f)

  And you can output text in that font with code like this, wherein `s` is that text as a `str`:

      print(figlet.renderText(s))

- Note that the `random` module comes with quite a few functions, per [docs.python.org/3/library/random.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html).

## Demo

This demo’s first output used a random font. Your output may vary.

## Before You Begin

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

    $

Next execute

    mkdir figlet

to make a folder called `figlet` in your codespace.

Then execute

    cd figlet

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `figlet/ $`. You can now execute

    code figlet.py

to make a file called `figlet.py` where you’ll write your program.

## How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python figlet.py test`. Your program should exit via `sys.exit` and print an error message:

      Invalid usage

- Run your program with `python figlet.py -a slant`. Your program should exit via `sys.exit` and print an error message:

      Invalid usage

- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f invalid_font`. Your program should exit via `sys.exit` and print an error message:

      Invalid usage

- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f slant`. Type `CS50`. Your program should print the following:

         ___________ __________
        / ____/ ___// ____/ __ \
       / /    \__ \/___ \/ / / /
      / /___ ___/ /___/ / /_/ /
      \____//____/_____/\____/

- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f rectangles`. Type `Hello, world`. Your program should print the following:

       _____     _ _                        _   _
      |  |  |___| | |___      _ _ _ ___ ___| |_| |
      |     | -_| | | . |_   | | | | . |  _| | . |
      |__|__|___|_|_|___| |  |_____|___|_| |_|___|
                        |_|

- Run your program with `python figlet.py -f alphabet`. Type `Moo`. Your program should print the following:

      M   M
      MM MM
      M M M ooo ooo
      M   M o o o o
      M   M ooo ooo

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

    check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/figlet

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## How to Submit

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.
