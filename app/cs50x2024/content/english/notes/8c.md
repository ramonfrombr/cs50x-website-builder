## HTTP

- _HTTP_ or _hypertext transfer protocol_ is an application-level protocol that developers use to build powerful and useful things.
- When you see an address such as `https://www.example.com` you are actually implicitly visiting that address with a `/` at the end of it.
- The _path_ is what exists after that slash. For example, `https://www.example.com/folder/file.html` visits `example.com` and browses to the `folder` folder and then visits the file named `file.html`.
- `https` in this address is the protocol that is used to connect to that web address. By protocol, we mean that HTTP utilizes `GET` or `POST` _requests_ to ask for information from a server. For example, you can launch Google Chrome, right-click, and click `inspect`. When you open the `developer tools` and visit `Network`, selecting `Preserve log`, you will see `Request Headers`. You’ll see mentions of `GET`. This is possible in other browsers as well, using slightly different methods.
- Generally, after making a request a server, you will receive the following in `Response Headers`:

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html

- This approach to inspecting these logs may be a bit more complicated than need be. You can analyze the work of HTTP protocols at [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io). For example, type the following in your terminal window:

        curl -I https://www.harvard.edu

  Notice that the output of this command returns all the header values of the responses of the server.

- Similarly, execute the following in your terminal window:

        curl -I http://www.harvard.edu

  Notice that the `s` in `https` has been removed. The server response will show that the response is `301` instead of `100`, meaning that the website has permanently moved.

- Further, execute the following command in your terminal window:

        curl -I https://harvard.edu

  Notice that you will see the same `301` response, providing a hint to a browser of where it can find the correct website.

- Similar to `301`, a code of `404` means that a specified URL has not been found. There are numerous other response codes, such as:

        200 OK
        301 Moved Permanently
        302 Found
        304 Not Modified
        304 Temporary Redirect
        401 Unauthorized
        403 Forbidden
        404 Not Found
        418 I'm a Teapot
        500 Internal Server Error
        503 Service Unavailable

- It’s worth mentioning that `500` errors are always your fault as the developer. This will be especially important for next week’s pset, and potentially for your final project!
- We can send more complicated commands to the server. For example, we can attempt the following:

        GET /search?q=cats HTTP/1.1
        Host: www.google.com

  Notice that not only are we specifying a path but also user input using the `?` mark. `q` is used to denote _query_, passing `cats` to it.

- If you manually type `google.com/search?=cats` into your web browser address bar, it will manually query Google for results related to `cats`.
