## hello, world

- The “when green flag clicked” block in Scratch starts the main program; clicking the green flag causes the right set of blocks underneath to start. In C, the first line for the same is `int main(void)`, which we’ll learn more about over the coming weeks, followed by an open curly brace `{`, and a closed curly brace `}`, wrapping everything that should be in our program.

      int main(void)
      {

      }

- The “say (hello, world)” block is a function, and maps to `printf("hello, world");`. In C, the function to print something to the screen is `printf`, where `f` stands for “format”, meaning we can format the printed string in different ways. Then, we use parentheses to pass in what we want to print. We have to use double quotes to surround our text so it’s understood as text, and finally, we add a semicolon `;` to end this line of code.
- To make our program work, we also need another line at the top, a header line `#include <stdio.h>` that defines the `printf` function that we want to use. Somewhere there is a file on our computer, `stdio.h`, that includes the code that allows us to access the `printf` function, and the `#include` line tells the computer to include that file with our program.
- To write our first program in Scratch, we opened Scratch’s website. Similarly, we’ll use the [CS50 Sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/) to start writing and running code the same way. The CS50 Sandbox is a virtual, cloud-based environment with the libraries and tools already installed for writing programs in various languages. At the top, there is a simple code editor, where we can type text. Below, we have a terminal window, into which we can type commands:  
  ![two panels, top labeled hello.c, bottom labeled Terminal](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/cs50_sandbox.png)
- We’ll type our code from earlier into the top, after using the `+` sign to create a new file called `hello.c`:  
  ![hello, world in editor](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/1/editor.png)
- We end our program’s file with `.c` by convention, to indicate that it’s intended as a C program. Notice that our code is colorized, so that certain things are more visible.
