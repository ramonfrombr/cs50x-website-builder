So along the way, it turns out that there are better ways to solve some of these problems. And we can actually start to think now a little more in terms of design, the design of the quality of your code. I'm going to go ahead and do this. Under events, I'm going to go ahead and grab when green flag is clicked, and I'm going to go ahead and say something this time. Let's go ahead and say cough for one second like this. And then let me go ahead and wait for some number of seconds, like one. And then you know what? Let me go ahead and cough three times. It's not uncommon when you're coughing, in the real world, to cough three times. So I'm going to right click or Control click, I'm going to go ahead and duplicate, and just attach another one of those. And I'm going to right click or Duplicate and give me one of these. And now, of course, the cat is going to cough, cough, cough or meow, and three times in a row. Now this code is correct. It does cough three times and it waits one second after each, but it's not very good code. It's not well-designed, as a computer scientist would say. What could we do better with this code based on the ideas we've seen thus far? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID MALAN: Yeah. So we can loop instead, right? And Copy Paste is rarely the solution when programming, be it in Scratch or in C or in Python or other languages. So I'm actually going to throw all of this away. Let me go ahead and just grab a repeat block, change that default ten to three. Let me grab these pairs of blocks and put them in here, drag and drop this up here. So now I'm going to go ahead and repeat three times, say cough for a second, and then wait one second. And now the program is just better designed. It is no different from before, but it's a little easier to maintain now for me or someone else because if I want to change how long something's happening or what's being said, I can change it now in one place instead of multiple.
