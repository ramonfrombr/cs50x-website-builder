## Password Managers

- Password managers can be used to create very challenging passwords and remember them for you.
- The probability of a password secured by a password manager being broken is very, very low.
- You’d hope that such password managers are secure. However, if one gains access to your password manager, they would have access to all your passwords.
- In the end, you are far less likely to be at risk by those you live with—and much more likely to be at risk by the billions of other people on the internet.
- As mentioned prior, you can make a decision based on a balance between security and convenience.

## Two-factor Authentication

- Adding another means by which you must authenticate adds further security. However, there is a human cost as you might not have access to your second factor.
- These are implemented as one-time passwords of sorts that are sent to an email, device, or phone number.
- Always, security policies attempt to balance the needs of security and human convenience.

## Hashing

- Your account information and other sensitive data should not be stored as raw text in an online database.
- If a database becomes compromised and all credentials are stored in plain text, credentials for other services at other websites are likely also compromised.
- Hence, hashing algorithms, as discussed earlier in this course, are used to store only hashed values of passwords.
- One-way hashing allows online services to actually _never_ store the original password typed by the user: Only the hashed value of these passwords. Accordingly, if there is a breach, only the hashed value will be known.
- _Rainbow tables_ are huge dictionaries that adversaries use to attempt to pre-hash possible passwords as a means by which to attempt to break the hash algorithm.
- As an additional process to heightened security, programmers may sometimes introduce _salting_ where it becomes unlikely that multiple users may have the same hash value to represent their passwords. You can imagine this as follows:
