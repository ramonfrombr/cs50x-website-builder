## Strings

- Strings are actually just arrays of characters. If we had a string `s`, each character can be accessed with `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and so on.
- And it turns out that a string ends with a special character, ‘\\0’, or a byte with all bits set to 0. This character is called the null character, or null terminating character. So we actually need four bytes to store our string “HI!”:  
  ![grid with H labeled s[0], I labeled s[1], ! labeled s[2], \0 labeled s[3], each of which takes up one box, and many empty boxes following](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/memory_with_string.png)
- Now let’s see what four strings in an array might look like:

      string names[4];
      names[0] = "EMMA";
      names[1] = "RODRIGO";
      names[2] = "BRIAN";
      names[3] = "DAVID";

      printf("%s\n", names[0]);
      printf("%c%c%c%c\n", names[0][0], names[0][1], names[0][2], names[0][3]);

  - We can print the first value in `names` as a string, or we can get the first string, and get each individual character in that string by using `[]` again. (We can think of it as `(names[0])[0]`, though we don’t need the parentheses.)
  - And though we know that the first name had four characters, `printf` probably used a loop to look at each character in the string, printing them one at a time until it reached the null character that marks the end of the string. And in fact, we can print `names[0][4]` as an `int` with `%i`, and see a `0` being printed.

- We can visualize each character with its own label in memory:  
  ![grid with E labeled names[0][0], M labeled names[0][1], and so on, until names[3][5] with a \0, each of which takes up one box, and empty boxes following](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/2/memory_with_string_array.png)
- We can try experimenting with `string0.c`:

      #include <cs50.h>
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <string.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          string s = get_string("Input:  ");
          printf("Output: ");
          for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++)
          {
              printf("%c", s[i]);
          }
          printf("\n");
      }

  - We can use the condition `s[i] != '\0'`, where we can check the current character and only print it if it’s not the null character.
  - We can also use the length of the string, but first, we need a new library, `string.h`, for `strlen`, which tells us the length of a string.

- We can improve the design of our program. `string0` was a bit inefficient, since we check the length of the string, after each character is printed, in our condition. But since the length of the string doesn’t change, we can check the length of the string once:

      #include <cs50.h>
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <string.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          string s = get_string("Input: ");
          printf("Output:\n");
          for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
          {
              printf("%c\n", s[i]);
          }
      }

  - Now, at the start of our loop, we initialize both an `i` and `n` variable, and remember the length of our string in `n`. Then, we can check the values each time, without having to actually calculate the length of the string.
  - And we did need to use a little more memory for `n`, but this saves us some time with not having to check the length of the string each time.
