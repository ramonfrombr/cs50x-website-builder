- You can also create forms reminiscent of Google’s search:

      <!DOCTYPE html>

      <!-- Demonstrates form -->

      <html lang="en">
          <head>
              <title>search</title>
          </head>
          <body>
              <form action="https://www.google.com/search" method="get">
                  <input name="q" type="search">
                  <input type="submit" value="Google Search">
              </form>
          </body>
      </html>

  Notice that a `form` tag opens and provides the attribute of what `action` it will take. The `input` field is included, passing the name `q` and the type as `search`.

- We can make this search better as follows:

      <!DOCTYPE html>

      <!-- Demonstrates additional form attributes -->

      <html lang="en">
          <head>
              <title>search</title>
          </head>
          <body>
              <form action="https://www.google.com/search" method="get">
                  <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="q" placeholder="Query" type="search">
                  <button>Google Search</button>
              </form>
          </body>
      </html>

  Notice that `autocomplete` is turned `off`. `autofocus` is enabled.

- We’ve seen just a few of many HTML elements you can add to your site. If you have an idea for something to add to your site that we haven’t seen yet (a button, an audio file, etc.) try Googling “X in HTML” to find the right syntax!
