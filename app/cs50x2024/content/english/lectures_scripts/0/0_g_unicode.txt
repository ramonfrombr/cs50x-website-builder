But of course, this is very American-centric at the moment. And indeed, the acronym ASCII has American in it. So it was biased early on to American English, for instance. But there's so many more characters in the world, of course, such as accented characters and other languages altogether. And frankly, there's also these things these days, which even though they look like pictures, you access them via your keyboard because they are indeed just symbols in an alphabet. There are zeros and ones, patterns of zeros and ones, that represent those characters, as well. That's what's known as Unicode, and that's, like, a superset of ASCII. Because ASCII, way back when, used only eight bits, which is not terribly many, to represent characters. Unicode uses 8 or 16 or 24 or even 32, which means we have a way many more possible patterns of zeros and ones with which to represent things like this. So this is face with tears of joy. As of 2019, it is the most popular emoji sent on iOS devices, at least. Does anyone want to hazard a guess as to what the decimal number is that represents a face with tears of joy? Not 65. Not 72. Not 73. 800. Higher than that. 10,000. Higher than that. It's 128,514. That's how many emojis await us down the road because the numbers are now getting this big. Or equivalently, this pattern of zeros and ones. So at the risk of taking all of the fun out of ever sending someone an emoji, when you send that face with tears of joy, you're literally just somehow having your phone send a friend's phone this pattern of zeros and ones. And Android or iOS are presenting it as that yellow picture.
