CSS
• CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is another language we use to when constructing websites.
• If HTML is used to organize the content that we aim to display on our pages, then CSS is the tool we use to customize our website’s look and feel.
• Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language; it lacks logic. Rather, it is a styling language and its syntax describes how certain attributes of HTML elements should be modified.

CSS
• A style sheet is constructed by identifying a selector (in the last example, body) and then an open curly brace to indicate the beginning of the style sheet for that selector.
• In between the curly brace you place a list of key-value pairs of style properties and values for those properties, each declaration ending with a semicolon.
• Then a closing curly brace terminates the style sheet.

• border: style color width
• Applies a border of the specified color, width, and style (e.g., dotted, dashed, solid, ridge…).
• background-color: [keyword | #<6-digit hex>]
• Sets the background color. Some colors are pre-defined in CSS.
• color: [keyword | #<6-digit hex>]
• Sets the foreground color (usually text).

CSS
• Common CSS properties
• font-size: [absolute size | relative size]
• Can use keywords (xx-small, medium…), fixed points (10pt, 12pt…), percentage (80%, 120%), or base off the most recent font size (smaller, larger).
• font-family: [font name | generic name]
• Certain “web safe” fonts are pre-defined in CSS.
• text-align: [left | right | center | justify]
• For displaying text.

CSS
• Your selectors don’t have to apply only to HTML tag categories. There also exist ID selectors and class selectors.
• A tag selector will apply to all elements with a given HTML tag.
h2
{
font-family: times;
color: #fefefe;
}

CSS
• Your selectors don’t have to apply only to HTML tag categories. There also exist ID selectors and class selectors.
• An ID selector will apply only to an HTML tag with a unique identifier.
#unique
{
border: 4px dotted blue;
text-align: right;
}

CSS
• Your selectors don’t have to apply only to HTML tag categories. There also exist ID selectors and class selectors.
• A class selector will apply only to those HTML tags that have been given identical “class” attributes.
.students
{
background-color: yellow;
opacity: 0.7;
}

CSS
• Style sheets can be written directly into your HTML.
• Place them within <style> tags within your page’s head.
• Style sheets can also be written as separate CSS files and then linked in to your document.
• Use <link> tags within your page’s head to accomplish this.
