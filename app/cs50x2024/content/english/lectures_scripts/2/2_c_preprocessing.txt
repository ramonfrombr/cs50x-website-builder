So let's take a look at pre-processing. This is a term of art in programming that refers to the following. When you have source code that looks like this, you have a couple of lines at the top that say hash include two files, two library files. Well, when you actually run Clang or you induce Clang to run by using Make, what happens is those lines that start with the hash symbol are actually sort of replaced with the actual contents of that file. 

So instead of this code remaining include CS50.h, literally what Clang does is go into CS50.h, grab the relevant lines of code, and essentially copy-paste them into your file, hello.c or whatever it's called. The next line here, standard io.h similarly gets replaced with whatever the lines of code are in that file, standard io.h. Doesn't matter to us what they are, but they look a little something like this, though I've simplified on the slide here. And there's a whole bunch of other stuff above and below those lines certainly in those files.
