So let's now consider this in the context of programming and how we can use a few new features today in C to solve problems better and to write better designed code. And we'll do that first by way of something that is called an array. So an array is something that allows us to solve a problem, in perhaps, the following way. So in our computers-- in our programs in C, we have choices of bunches of data types. We've seen that there's chars, there's ints, there's floats, there's longs, there's doubles, there's bool, there's now string, and there's actually a few others as well. And each of those, depending on the computer system you're using, does take up a specific amount of space, on CS50, IDE, on the sandbox, and most likely on your own personal Macs and PCs. 

These days, each one of these data types, if you're writing a program in C, takes up this much space, where one byte is 8 bits, 4 bytes is 32 bits, 8 bytes is 64 bits, to tie it back to week zero. So these are data types that we have at our disposal for any variables in our computer's memory.
