Command-Line Arguments

Command-Line Arguments
● So far, all of your programs have begun pretty much the same way.
● Since we’ve been collecting user input through in-program prompts, we haven’t needed to modify 
this declaration of main().
● If we want the user to provide data to our program before the program starts running, we need a new 
form.
int main(void)
{

Command-Line Arguments
● To collect so called command-line arguments from the user, declare main as:
● These two special arguments enable you to know what data the user provided at the command line 
and how much data they provided.
int main(int argc, string argv[])
{

Command-Line Arguments
● argc (argument count)
● This integer-type variable will store the number of command-line arguments the user typed when the 
program was executed.
command
argc
./greedy
1
./greedy 1024 cs50
3

Command-Line Arguments
● argv (argument vector)
● This array of strings stores, one string per element, the actual text the user typed at the command-line when 
the program was executed.
● The first element of argv is always found at argv[0]. The last element of argv is always found at 
argv[argc-1]. 
● Do you see why?

Command-Line Arguments
● argv (argument vector)
● Let’s assume the user executes the greedy program as follows
argv indices
argv contents
argv[0]
“./greedy”
argv[1]
argv[2]
argv[3]
./greedy 1024 cs50

argv[3]
./greedy 1024 cs50
