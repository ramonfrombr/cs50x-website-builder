In C, at least in the CS50 Sandbox, the closest equivalent to the ask function in Scratch is going to be a C function called get_string. A string is just a programmer's expression for a word or phrase or a sentence. So text as opposed to numbers or some other piece of data. So get_string is the closest analog to the ask function there. In between the parentheses, which imply here's where you can provide some input, I can go ahead and provide the prompt that the user is going to see on the screen-- for instance, what's your name, quote unquote. Now, why the quotes? I just claimed earlier that anytime you pass a string-- a word, a phrase, alphabetical characters-- you have to surround them with double quotes on the left and double quotes on the right. And to be clear, why did I have this weird incantation here, backslash n? AUDIENCE: New line. DAVID MALAN: Yeah, it just moves the cursor to the new line. Why? Just because it looks a little prettier. I don't have to. And indeed, a moment ago, my own computer prompted me to say yes or no, and it did not move the cursor to the next line. That's because that programmer decided not to bother doing that. But I'll go ahead and keep things clean by doing this.
