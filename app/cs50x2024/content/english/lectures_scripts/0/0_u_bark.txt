But you don't have to have just one cat or one sprite in a program. We can actually have multiple. Let me go ahead and open up another animal here. This one, a sea lion. So in this sea lion here, if I See Inside and see its code, there's a lot going on here. So let's see what this thing does first. If I go ahead and click the green flag-- [SEA LION BARKING] --it's really, really annoying. [SEA LION BARKING] Now, why is that? There's some loop in here, clearly, that's just doing the same thing again and again and again. How might, based on this code, I stop the sea lion from barking? Yeah. So that's the solution. Let's go ahead and hit the space bar. Why did that actually get him to stop barking? Well, notice this. There's two scripts in this program, which is a little different from before. Each of these represents a script or a program. Notice here there's a variable called muted, and by default, it's false. That is off. So muted is false, or off, which means it's not muted, which is why we hear it. Then it does forever the following. If the key space is pressed, go ahead and check the following question. If muted is true, change muted to false, else change muted to true. So this is a very common approach in programming where if you have a variable, like something called muted that's either true or false, 1 or 0, on or off, you can change its value by just asking that question. If muted is true, change it to false, else set it to true. Meanwhile, if we scroll up, there's another script here that was doing something again and again. And I'll zoom in on this one. When the green flag was clicked, the sea lion was also forever doing this. If muted is false, that is, if it's not muted, go ahead and play the sound sea lion and go ahead and say hi, hi, hi for two seconds and then wait for one second. And do that again and again and again.
