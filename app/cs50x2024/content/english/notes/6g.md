## More features

- We can take command-line arguments with:

      from sys import argv

      for i in range(len(argv)):
          print(argv[i])

  - Since `argv` is a list of strings, we can use `len()` to get its length, and `range()` for a range of values that we can use as an index for each element in the list.

- But we can also let Python iterate over the list for us:

      from sys import argv

      for arg in argv:
          print(arg)

- We can return exit codes when our program exits, too:

      from sys import argv, exit

      if len(argv) != 2:
          print("missing command-line argument")
          exit(1)
      print(f"hello, {argv[1]}")
      exit(0)

  - We import the `exit` function, and call it with the code we want our program to exit with.

- We can implement linear search by just checking each element in a list:

      import sys

      names = ["EMMA", "RODRIGO", "BRIAN", "DAVID"]

      if "EMMA" in names:
          print("Found")
          sys.exit(0)
      print("Not found")
      sys.exit(1)
