But of course, that's about as versatile as cs50 sandbox gets when it comes to solving problems. You can write code up here. You can compile and run code down here. And there are commands like help 50 and a few others we'll see that you can run to improve your code, but the sandbox itself is actually pretty limited. And so today, we're going to introduce another programming environment that fundamentally is the same thing, it just has additional features, particularly ones related to debugging. 

So here now, is what is called CS50 IDE. IDE is a term of art for integrated development environment. You might have used it if you programed before in high school things like Eclipse or Visual Studio or NetBeans or a bunch of other tools as well. If you've ever used any of these tools, that's fine. Most students have not. But CS50 IDE is just sort of a fancier version of CS50 sandbox that adds some additional tools, like debugging tools. 

And so here I've gone ahead and logged in advance to CS50 IDE, and it's pretty much the same layout. On the top of the window is where my tabs with my code will go. On the bottom is my terminal window. It happens to be blue instead of black, but that's just an aesthetic detail. But you'll see a teaser over here of other features, including what's called the debugger, a program that's going to let me actually step through my code, step by step.
