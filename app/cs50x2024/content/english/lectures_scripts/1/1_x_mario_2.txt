So let me go ahead and jump ahead a couple of iterations to an example I'll call mario2.c, which just does all of this. So this is actually pretty involved, but notice what it's doing. In main, I'm saying, hey, give me an integer called n. Do the following while n is less than 1. So this is just a way of asking, what is the width of the blocks that you want to print? Then, once I have that answer, I can go ahead and, just as before, print that many question marks n times, one at a time. And at the very end, I'll print just a new line. So in short, if you want to create a program, albeit in text, that does something like this, and I make mario2-- whoops. And I make mario2, Enter, and type ./mario2, I can do a width of four and get four question marks. Or I can do 50 and get many more on the screen, all by just using these basic building blocks. But notice, because of that do-while loop, if I don't cooperate and I do something like 0 or negative 1 or negative 50, I just keep getting prompted again and again, because n is less than 1. That's the kind of logic that you can impose there.
