So in this programming environment, I'm going to go ahead and click this plus sign up top for new file or tab. By convention, I'm going to go ahead and name my file something like hello.c. Hello just because I want this program to say hello, but I could call it anything I want. And dot c because the convention, in this programming language C, is to name your files that contain your code with literally dot c, much like you have dot doc or dot x for Microsoft Word, dot gif for graphical files, and the like. So I'm going to go ahead and click Create File. And you'll see now that I have a blinking prompt on line 1-- it's going to automatically number my lines for me-- in a tab called hello.c. This is where I can write code. Now, even though the code I'm about to write is, frankly, pretty cryptic-- include standard.io, int main void. And then in here, I'm going to do printf, quote, unquote, "hello world" semicolon. I have just written my first program in C. So I'm going to go ahead and zoom in at top left. It's six lines of code total. And you'll see that I have include stdio.h, whatever that means, int main void, whatever that means. And then, really, the essence of this program is on line 5-- print, or printf for formatting, "hello world." So recall that int main void is similar in spirit to the when green flag clicked. And printf is similar to the say block. And this top line of code, we just need it, because the computer is not going to understand printf unless I tell it to include that file.
