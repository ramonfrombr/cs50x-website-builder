So how might I go ahead and do this? Let me go ahead and open up this example, which I've made in advance. This one's called bounce one. And in bounce one here, I have the following second costume. If I go ahead and click See Inside and click Play Now, you'll notice now he's kind of moving. It's a little jaggy because he's moving from one position to another really quickly, but now it's the illusion of movement. So if you've ever played a game or you've ever created some animation yourself or even a film, this really is what's been happening underneath the hood all this time.
