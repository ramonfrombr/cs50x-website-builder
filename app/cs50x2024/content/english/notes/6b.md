## Examples

- We can blur an image with:

      from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

      before = Image.open("bridge.bmp")
      after = before.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
      after.save("out.bmp")

  - In Python, we include other libraries with `import`, and here we’ll `import` the `Image` and `ImageFilter` names from the `PIL` library.
  - It turns out, if we look for documention for the `PIL` library, we can use the next three lines of code to open an image called `bridge.bmp`, run a blur filter on it, and save it to a file called `out.bmp`.
  - And we can run this with `python blur.py` after saving to a file called `blur.py`.

- We can implement a dictionary with:

      words = set()

      def check(word):
          if word.lower() in words:
              return True
          else:
              return False

      def load(dictionary):
          file = open(dictionary, "r")
          for line in file:
              words.add(line.rstrip("\n"))
          file.close()
          return True

      def size():
          return len(words)

      def unload():
          return True

  - First, we create a new set called `words`. Then, for `check`, we can just ask \` `if word.lower() in words`. For `load`, we open the file and use `words.add` to add each line to our set. For `size`, we can use `len` to count the number of elements in our set, and finally, for `unload`, we don’t have to do anything!
