## Linked Lists

- With a **linked list**, we can store a list of values that can easily be grown by storing values in different parts of memory:  
  ![grid representing memory, with three of the boxes labeled with empty boxes between them, each labeled 1 0x123, 2 0x456, and 3 0x789](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/5/linked_list.png)
  - This is different than an array since our values are no longer next to one another in memory.
- We can link our list together by allocating, for each element, enough memory for both the value we want to store, and the address of the next element:  
  ![three boxes, each divided in two and labeled (1 0x123 and 0x456), (2 0x456 and 0x789), and (3 0x789 and NULL)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/5/linked_list_with_addresses.png)
  - By the way, `NUL` refers to `\0`, a character that ends a string, and `NULL` refers to an address of all zeros, or a null pointer that we can think of as pointing nowhere.
- Unlike we can with arrays, we no longer randomly access elements in a linked list. For example, we can no longer access the 5th element of the list by calculating where it is, in constant time. (Since we know arrays store elements back-to-back, we can add 1, or 4, or the size of our element, to calculate addresses.) Instead, we have to follow each element’s pointer, one at a time. And we need to allocate twice as much memory as we needed before for each element.
- In code, we might create our own struct called `node` (like a node from a graph in mathematics), and we need to store both an `int` and a pointer to the next `node` called `next`:

      typedef struct node
      {
          int number;
          struct node *next;
      }
      node;

  - We start this struct with `typedef struct node` so that we can refer to a `node` inside our struct.

- We can build a linked list in code starting with our struct. First, we’ll want to remember an empty list, so we can use the null pointer: `node *list = NULL;`.
- To add an element, first we’ll need to allocate some memory for a node, and set its values:

      node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
      // We want to make sure malloc succeeded in getting memory for us:
      if (n != NULL)
      {
          // This is equivalent to (*n).number, where we first go to the node pointed
          // to by n, and then set the number property. In C, we can also use this
          // arrow notation:
          n->number = 2;
          // Then we need to store a pointer to the next node in our list, but the
          // new node won't point to anything (for now):
          n->next = NULL;
      }

- Now our list can point to this node: `list = n;`:  
  ![a box labeled list with arrow outwards pointing to two connected boxes, one with 2 and one empty)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/5/list_with_one_node.png)
- To add to the list, we’ll create a new node the same way, perhaps with the value 4. But now we need to update the pointer in our first node to point to it.
- Since our `list` pointer points only to the first node (and we can’t be sure that the list only has one node), we need to “follow the breadcrumbs” and follow each node’s next pointer:

      // Create temporary pointer to what list is pointing to
      node *tmp = list;
      // As long as the node has a next pointer ...
      while (tmp->next != NULL)
      {
          // ... set the temporary to the next node
          tmp = tmp->next;
      }
      // Now, tmp points to the last node in our list, and we can update its next
      // pointer to point to our new node.

- If we want to insert a node to the front of our linked list, we would need to carefully update our node to point to the one following it, before updating list. Otherwise, we’ll lose the rest of our list:

      // Here, we're inserting a node into the front of the list, so we want its
      // next pointer to point to the original list, before pointing the list to
      // n:
      n->next = list;
      list = n;

- And to insert a node in the middle of our list, we can go through the list, following each element one at a time, comparing its values, and changing the `next` pointers carefully as well.
- With some volunteers on the stage, we simulate a list, with each volunteer acting as the `list` variable or a node. As we insert nodes into the list, we need a temporary pointer to follow the list, and make sure we don’t lose any parts of our list. Our linked list only points to the first node in our list, so we can only look at one node at a time, but we can dynamically allocate more memory as we need to grow our list.
