So if I, on my computer here, open a file that I had-- came with in advance, that you can also play with online as well, called, finally, shows.db. And I do .schema on this one. This is the largest of the databases, and this is the one that we, the staff, actually generated from all of the TSV files online, but we threw away a lot of information. We threw away anything before 1970, and we filtered out everything except TV series, so that we can actually play with the data in this data set.
